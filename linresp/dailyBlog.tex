\chapter{Research blog on linear response}
\label{c-DailyBlog}

\begin{description}

\item[2015-10-16 Predrag] We can write up the narrative starting with
    this file, in this folder, \texttt{reducesymm/linresp/}, with all
    stuff that does not belong to the public version bracketed by
    \texttt{ifboyscout}...\texttt{fi} . You can clip \& paste anything
    from here or from ChaosBook.org, if that saves you LaTeXing time.

\item[2015-10-18 Ben] Added figures to \texttt{linresp/figs/}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \texttt{tentmapexample.png}
    image of tent map with $\epsilon$ perturbation
  \item \texttt{numeric.png}
    plot of numerical and exact analytic calculations of leading
    eigenvalue for perturbed tent map, along with analytic
    calculation of leading eigenvalue for unperturbed map
  \item \texttt{logisticnumeric.png}
    analytic calculation of leading eigenvalue for perturbed
    logistic map
\end{itemize}

Have a glance at
\refrefs{AbrMaj08,Abramov09,Abramov10,Abramov12,Abramov12a,AbrKje13},
report here if you find/learn anything of interest.

We have to find and read Ruelle\rf{Ruelle12} and
Baladi papers on linear response. Baladi's\rf{BalTod15} in
{\em Linear response for intermittent maps} writes ``This is the first
time that a linear response formula for the SRB measure is obtained in
the setting of slowly mixing dynamics'',

``theme of linear response was explored in a few pioneering
papers\rf{Ruelle98,KKPW89,Ruelle97} in the setting of smooth hyperbolic
dynamics (Anosov or Axiom A)"

``It was soon realised that existence of a spectral gap is not sufficient
to guarantee linear response when bifurcations are present (see e.g.
\refrefs{Baladi07,BalSma08}). In the other direction, neither the
spectral gap nor structural stability is necessary for linear response,
as was shown by Dolgopyat\rf{Dolgopyat04} who obtained a linear response
formula for some rapidly mixing system."

``The intuition that a key sufficient condition is convergence of the sum
was confirmed by \rf{HaiMaj10} [Remark 2.4]"

``Another lesson of recent research [Ru1] \rf{Ruelle09,Baladi14,Baladi08}
[CD] on linear response is that understanding the singularities of the
SRB measure is essential."

\item[2015-10-19 Ben] Singling out one more potentially interesting paper from the stack, 
\rf{BalSma08}, Baladi's {\em Linear response formula for piecewise expanding unimodal maps}. 
This is a proof of an extension of Ruelle's linear response formula 
{\em Differentiation of SRB states} to the nonuniformly hyperbolic case.

"[for $f_{t}$ a smooth one-parameter family of piecewise expanding interval maps] ...Linear response is violated if and only if $f_{t}$ is transversal to the topological class of $f$."
