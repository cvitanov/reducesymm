\chapter{Research blog on linear response}
\label{c-DailyBlog}

\begin{description}

\item[2015-10-16 Predrag] We can write up the narrative starting with
    this file, in this folder, \texttt{reducesymm/linresp/}, with all
    stuff that does not belong to the public version bracketed by
    \texttt{ifboyscout}...\texttt{fi} . You can clip \& paste anything
    from here or from ChaosBook.org, if that saves you LaTeXing time.

\item[2015-10-18 Ben] Added figures to \texttt{linresp/figs/}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \texttt{tentmapexample.png}
    image of tent map with $\epsilon$ perturbation
  \item \texttt{numeric.png}
    plot of numerical and exact analytic calculations of leading
    eigenvalue for perturbed tent map, along with analytic
    calculation of leading eigenvalue for unperturbed map
  \item \texttt{logisticnumeric.png}
    analytic calculation of leading eigenvalue for perturbed
    logistic map
\end{itemize}

\item[2015-10-18 Predrag]
Have a glance at
\refrefs{AbrMaj08,Abramov09,Abramov10,Abramov12,Abramov12a,AbrKje13},
report here if you find/learn anything of interest.


We have to find and read Ruelle\rf{Ruelle12} and Baladi papers on
linear response.
