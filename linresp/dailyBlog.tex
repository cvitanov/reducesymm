\item[2015-10-16 Predrag] We can write up the narrative starting with
    this file, in this folder, \texttt{reducesymm/linresp/}, with all
    stuff that does not belong to the public version bracketed by
    \texttt{ifboyscout}...\texttt{fi} . You can clip \& paste anything
    from here or from ChaosBook.org, if that saves you LaTeXing time.

Have a glance at
\refrefs{AbrMaj08,Abramov09,Abramov10,Abramov12,Abramov12a,AbrKje13},
report here if you find/learn anything of interest.

We have to find and read Ruelle\rf{Ruelle12} and
Baladi papers on linear response. Baladi's\rf{BalTod15} in
{\em Linear response for intermittent maps} writes ``This is the first
time that a linear response formula for the SRB measure is obtained in
the setting of slowly mixing dynamics'',

``theme of linear response was explored in a few pioneering
papers\rf{Ruelle98,KKPW89,Ruelle96} in the setting of smooth hyperbolic
dynamics (Anosov or Axiom A)"

``It was soon realised that existence of a spectral gap is not sufficient
to guarantee linear response when bifurcations are present (see e.g.
\refrefs{Baladi07,BalSma08}). In the other direction, neither the
spectral gap nor structural stability is necessary for linear response,
as was shown by Dolgopyat\rf{Dolgopyat04} who obtained a linear response
formula for some rapidly mixing system."

``The intuition that a key sufficient condition is convergence of the sum
was confirmed by \rf{HaiMaj10} [Remark 2.4]"

``Another lesson of recent research [Ru1] \rf{Ruelle09,Baladi14,Baladi08}
[CD] on linear response is that understanding the singularities of the
SRB measure is essential."

She also refers to these:

\item[2015-10-19 Ben] Singling out one more potentially interesting paper from the stack,
Baladi's\rf{BalSma08} {\em Linear response formula for piecewise expanding unimodal maps}.
This is a proof of an extension of Ruelle's linear response formula
{\em Differentiation of SRB states} to the nonuniformly hyperbolic case.

"[for $f_{t}$ a smooth one-parameter family of piecewise expanding
interval maps] ...Linear response is violated if and only if $f_{t}$ is
transversal to the topological class of $f$."

\item[2015-10-19 Predrag]
Some of this literature has to be referred to and explained in the
introduction, so we need to understand it conceptually (but no need of
working through the proofs):

``Topological class of $f$'' presumably means that all admissible orbits
are the same for each element of the class. Not sure one can define that
without having symbolic dynamics. ``$f_{t}$ is \emph{transversal} to the
topological class of $f$" means that for any value of the parameter $t$
in an open interval around $t=0$ the dynamical system \PCedit{leaves} the
topological class.
% [2015-10-20 Predrag] had written "stays in the same topological class".
%       that was wrong.
\PCedit{
For ``perturbations $f_t$ \emph{tangent} to the topological class of $f$''
$f_t$ stays in the same topological class
}

``If $f$ is a sufficiently smooth uniformly hyperbolic diffeomorphism
restricted to a transitive attractor,
Ruelle\rf{Ruelle96,Ruelle98,Ruelle98a,Ruelle03} proved that $R (t)$ is
differentiable at $t = 0$.  In addition, Ruelle gave an explicit `linear
response formula' for $R'( 0 )$ , depending on $f_t$ only through its
linear part (the `infinitesimal deformation').''

I agree with that. I expect `linear response formulas' to be correct for such dynamical
systems, but they are rare and non-generic: some piecewise linear 1\dmn\
maps and weakly nonlinear cat maps. Baladi turns to the generic case next,
for which I expect no `linear response formula' can be defined, as any
change in parameter $t$ leads to creation and destruction of infinitely
many cycles:

``A much more difficult situation consists of studying nonuniformly
hyperbolic interval maps $f$, e.g. smooth unimodal maps. For some of
these maps, in particular those which satisfy the Collet-Eckmann
condition, there exists a unique SRB measure.  Two new difficulties are
that structural stability does not hold (in a rather drastic way), and
that $f_t$ will not always have an SRB measure even if $f$
has one.''

I think Smale's statement `a dynamical system is structurally stable'
means the same (and more precisely stated) as ``$f_{t}$ is
\PCedit{tangential} to the topological class of $f$''.
% [2015-10-20 Predrag] "transverse" was wrong.


`Collet-Eckmann condition' applies to smooth unimodal maps (think
parabola) and says that no matter how close a generic infinite-time orbit
comes to the critical point, it's Lyapunov exponent is strictly bounded
away from zero. So there are no stable limit cycles. Change the parameter
$t$ infinitesimally (in every open neighborhood there are parameter
values for which the limit is a stable periodic orbit) and - boom! - the
attractor is gone, just like in the ChaosBook H{\'e}non map example.

\item[2015-10-19 Predrag]
Young\rf{Young02} apparently defines something called `physical measure'.
Curious what that is.

\item[2015-10-19 Ben]
I'm unclear on the distinction between 'transverse to the topological
class of $f$' and 'tangential to the topological class of $f$'. From
Baladi\rf{BalSma08},
    \PC{2015-10-20}{Unfortunately, there is no good way of transferring
    formulas between any two formats by clip \& paste. I find it quickest
    to go to \arXiv{0705.3383}, then
    \HREF{http://arxiv.org/e-print/0705.3383}{[ Download source ]}, add
    suffix \texttt{.tex}, and the canibalize \texttt{0705.3383.tex}
    }
% Predrag replaced the LaTeX unreadable text by Bladi source file:
%[For integers r ≥ r0 ≥ 2, and a piecewise expanding C^{r} unimodal map f, a C^{r0,r} perturbation of f tangent to
%the topological class of f is a C^{r0,r} perturbation f_{t} of f so that there exist a C^{2,2} perturbation
%f^{~}_{t} of f with sup_{x}|f^{~}_{t}(x) − f_{t}(x)| = O(t^{2})) and homeomorphisms h_{t} with h_{t}(c) = c and
%f^{~}t = h_{t} ◦ f ◦ h^{−1}_{t}.]

\begin{quote}
For  integers $r \ge r_0 \ge 2$, and a piecewise expanding $C^{r}$ unimodal map
$f$, a {\it $C^{r_0,r}$ perturbation of $f$ tangent to the topological class of $f$}
is a $C^{r_0, r}$ perturbation $f_t$ of $f$ so that
there exist a $C^{2,2}$ perturbation
$\tilde f_t$ of $f$  with
$$\sup_x|\tilde f_t(x)-f_t(x)|=O(t^2)$$
and
homeomorphisms $h_t$  with $h_t(c)=c$ and
$\tilde f_t=h_t \circ f \circ h_t^{-1}$.
\end{quote}


This sounds a lot like topological conjugacy between $f$ and $f^{~}_{t}$,
and that $f^{~}_{t}$ is the same as $f_{t}$ to leading order. Baladi goes
on to note that this implies linearizations of $f_{t}$ and $f^{~}_{t}$
are the same, which is reasonable.

So, it seems '$f_{t}$ tangential to the topological class of $f$' is
equivalent to structural stability of $f$. Or do I have this backwards?

\item[2015-10-20 Predrag] Oops! Thanks for correcting me, I got it
backwards - now fixed in the the text above.

\item[2015-10-19 Ben]
From \rf{Young02},

\begin{quote}
Let $f : M \to M$ be an arbitrary map and $\mu$ an invariant probability
measure. We call $\mu$ a physical measure if there is a positive Lebesgue
measure set $V \subset M$ such that for every continuous observable $\phi
: M \to R$, $\frac{1}{n}\sum^{n-1}_{i=0} \phi(f^{i}x) \rightarrow \int
\phi d\mu$ for every $x \in V$ .
\end{quote}

So an invariant measure is physical if the set of $\mu$-generic points in
$M$ (ie set of ergodic orbits?) has positive Lebesgue measure.

\item[2015-10-20 Predrag] I guess... There must be some more
user-friendly way to say this.

\item[2015-10-20 Ben]
\HREF{https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=LsShXi0AAAAJ&hl=en&oi=sra}
{Alves} is a little better, from \refref{Alves06}:
\begin{quote}
It easily follows from Birkhoff Ergodic Theorem that if
$\mu$ is an ergodic probability measure which is absolutely
continuous with respect to the Lebesgue measure, i.e. it
does not give positive weight to sets with zero Lebesgue
measure, then $\mu$ is a physical measure. ]
\end{quote}

% p.s. thanks for formatting tips!

\item[2015-10-21 Predrag]
\refRef{Alves06} seem not published - check whether
\refref{AlvSou13} can be used instead? They seem to cite
\refref{ArPaPuVi09}. There is a discussion
\HREF{http://mathoverflow.net/questions/159775/physical-measure-vs-srb-measures}
{here}. They refer to Dirac function concentrated measure  as atomic.

`Physical measure' was introduced by Pugh and Shub\rf{PugShu89} (PC:
except that the word `physical' does not seem to appear in the article.
Not an easy read).

Maybe the best reference to clarify that is L.S. Young\rf{Young02}:
\emph{What are SRB Measures, and which dynamical Systems have them}
(which puts us back to where we started, precisely :)
