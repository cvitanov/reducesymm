Re:  LG15919E
        Neighborhoods of periodic orbits and the stationary
        distribution of a noisy chaotic system
    Jeffrey M. Heninger, Domenico Lippolis, and Predrag Cvitanovi\'c

-----------------------------------------------------------------
Response to the First Referee -- LG15919E/Heninger
-----------------------------------------------------------------

Referee:
    1. The impact of the paper could be stated more clearly. I mean
    what problems can be addressed and solved using the suggested
    method? Some discussions of this is present, but it takes time
    to locate it.

Response:
    In the revised paper we have added a paragraph starting with
    "The problems dynamical chaos..." to make that clearer

Referee:
    2. What is the profit of the suggested partitioning method
    compared with others? I am sure that a reader not engaged
    deeply into this particular topic can have questions, like the
    following. What if one just cover the attractor with identical
    small balls? Or maybe it is better not to spend time computing
    the Gaussian approximations (I suspect that these computations
    will be not so fast), but just take arbitrary boxes near
    periodic points and fit them together? At least a couple of
    words and/or references answering these and similar naive
    questions are very welcome.

Response:
    In the revised paper we have #######.

Referee:
    3. The authors implicitly assume that the invariant
    distribution of a system with noise can be represented as a
    decomposition over Gaussian curves. Is it really the case? Do
    Gaussian curves form an appropriate basis? Some proving
    discussion or references are required.

Response:
    In the revised paper we have #######.

Referee:
    4. I suggest to be more introductive explaining the core of the
    method.

Response:
    We have rewritten the introduction from the scratch. Hopefully
    now the introduction defines the problem and motivates our
    solution in a clearer way.
