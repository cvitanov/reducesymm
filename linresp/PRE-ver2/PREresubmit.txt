In reviewing the figures of your paper, we note that the following
changes would be needed in order for your figures to conform to the
style of the Physical Review.  Please check all figures for the
following problems and make appropriate changes in the text of the
paper itself wherever needed for consistency.

* The size and font of the letters and numbers appearing in figures
  should be uniform (or close to it). Please make the letters and
  numbers more consistent.

* Captions to color PostScript figures should begin with "(Color
  online)", unless they are to be published in color in print, in
  which case they should begin "(Color)".
