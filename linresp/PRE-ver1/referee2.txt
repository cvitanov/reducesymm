The paper addresses the problem of the construction of an approximate
invariant measure for a noisy discrete hyperbolic dynamical system.
The basic idea is to use the skeleton of periodic orbits for the
deterministic part, up to prime periods determined by the noise level.
The idea is implemented in a ingenious way, where at first local
invariant density is constructed around a periodic point of the
deterministic system (the scheme is presented in a concise but
understandable manner), and then approximating the invariant density
by the collection of such local expressions up to an overlapping
condition. As a test for checking the effectiveness of the method, the
authors use Lozi map, and, besides providing a qualitative overview of
the resulting density and the way the phase space is tessellated by
local neighborhoods, they compare escape rates (induced by the noise)
with direct methods (requiring much finer partitions). The paper
contains new and interesting results, is clearly written, and
addresses a subject of wide interest, so I suggest publication
