\exercise{H\'enon temporal lattice.}{\label{exer:tempHen}

1\dmn\ temporal H\'enon lattice (see
ChaosBook $\!$\HREF{http://ChaosBook.org/chapters/ChaosBook.pdf\#section.3.4}
{Example 3.5}) is given by a 3-term recurrence
\beq \nonumber
\ssp_{n+1} + a \ssp_n^2 - b\,\ssp_{n-1} = 1
\,.
\eeq
The parameter $a$ quantifies the ``stretching'' and $b$ quantifies the
``contraction''.

The single H\'enon map is nice because the system is nonlinear, but has
binary dynamics.

The assignement: Implement the variational searches for
periodic states in Matt's \HREF{https://github.com/farom57/Orbit-hunter}
{OrbitHunter}, find all periodic lattice states up to $n=6$.

(a) $a=1.4\,\;b=0.3$, compare with ChaosBook
\HREF{http://chaosbook.org/chapters/ChaosBook.pdf\#section*.550}
{Table~34.2}.

(b) For $b=-1$ the system is time-reversible or `Hamiltonian',
see
ChaosBook $\!$\HREF{http://ChaosBook.org/chapters/ChaosBook.pdf\#chapter.8}
{Example 8.5}.

Note also
\HREF{http://chaosbook.org/chapters/ChaosBook.pdf\#section.J.3}
{sect~A10.3} {\em H\'enon map symmetries}
and
\HREF{http://chaosbook.org/chapters/ChaosBook.pdf\#section.7.3}
{Exer.~7.2} {\em Inverse iteration method}.

The deviation of an approximate trajectory from the 3-term recurrence is
\beq \nonumber
v_n = \ssp_{n+1} - (1 - a \ssp_n^2 + b\,\ssp_{n-1})
\eeq
In classical mechanics force is the gradient of potential, which
Biham-Wenzel\rf{afind} construct as a cubic potential
\beq \nonumber
V_n = \ssp_n(\ssp_{n+1} - b\,\ssp_{n-1} - 1) + a \ssp_n^3
\eeq
With the cubic potential of a single H\'enon map we can start to look for
orbits variationally.
