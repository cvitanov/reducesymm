The reference to an early use of diagrammatic notation is R.
Brauer\rf{Brauer1937} {\em On algebras which are connected with the
semisimple continuous groups} in 1937. The algebra he constructs is now
called the Brauer algebra (essentially birdtracks for SO/Sp:1), but people
now study it algebraically. I had a student who worked on it and found a nice
basis for it in his Ph.D thesis.

\item[2003-03-19  Dirk Kreimer] told me to
read these (perhaps they belong to the QFT blog):

Lavelle and D. McMullan\rf{LavMcM97}
(Predrag not sure if this is the right one, they have many articles together.
Could also be \refrefs{BaLaMcM97,BaLaMcM98})

Suslov\rf{Suslov99}

Rota: On combinatoric (book)
	article on Moebius Function

\item[2015-12-02  Predrag]
Should one study
Klink and Wickramasekara\rf{KliWic15},
{\em Relativity, Symmetry and the Structure of Quantum Theory I} ?
They say: ``The history of how quantum mechanics was developed is a
fascinating one and underlies the focus of this book; namely, given the
rules that the founders of quantum mechanics developed, is it possible to
find principles that lead to the structure of quantum mechanics as it was
historically formulated? This is the first book in a series of works
considering what particular relativity is applicable to a given dynamical
theory. The series considers Newton, Einstein, and de Sitter
relativities, while this book examines the unitary irreducible
representations of the Galilei group and see how they provide the
framework for Galilean quantum theory.

in Particle, Nuclear, and Hadron Physics} will be available in July 2016.
