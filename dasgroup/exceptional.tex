Phil Morrison told me that Birkhoff discovered $G_2$ while looking for
hidden symmetries of the heat kernel. Did not find the reference (it is
in his thin book on statistical mechanics?) but this is of interest:

Ilka Agricola\rf{Agricola08} writes:
``
In a talk delivered in Leipzig on June 11, 1900, Friedrich
Engel\rf{Engel1900} gave the first public account of his newly discovered
description of the smallest exceptional Lie group $G_2$, and he wrote in
the corresponding note to the Royal Saxonian Academy of Sciences:
Moreover, we hereby obtain a direct definition of our 14-dimensional
simple group $G_2$ which is as elegant as one can wish for. Indeed,
Engel's definition of $G_2$ as the isotropy group of a generic 3-form in
7 dimensions is at the basis of a rich geometry that exists only on
7-dimensional manifolds,
''

This is precisely how I think of $G_2$, so should give Engel and
Reichel credit, and
cite Agricola\rf{Agricola08}.

One immediately discovers that Baez and Huerta\rf{BaeHue14} think of
$G_2$ as a small ball rolling on a big ball, and so on; with this one can
be infinitely distracted.

The\rf{Tai13} {\em Exceptionally simple PDE}: ``
[...] a remarkably uniform generalization of the Cartan-Engel models from
1893 in the $G_2$ case.

I at last have maybe some hint on the difference and on the common origin
of our two distinct magic triangles. I asked P. Deligne for advice but not
very diplomatically I enquired about his relation with your work so total
silence was the answer.
I discussed since with P. Vogel and was wondering whether you had made
progress. My breakthrough comes out of nowhere so it takes time to
decipher.
I suggested to Vogel he should go beyond powers of the adjoint
representation (your idea for the triangle) I probably should do it if it
has not been done before...

complaining that `` I do not know why Deligne is so unwilling to cite my
work that precedes his - he has known about it forever
(\HREF{http://birdtracks.eu/extras/Deligne96.pdf} {click here}). I
have never met him. I had once been in Vogel's office (about 10 years
ago?). The desk was covered by birdtracks :) I'm a bit annoyed that that
things that I did decades before Vogel and are now credited to them, and
I get cited only for Vogletracks, not Vogelsong. But I do have a tenured
job and freedom to do anything, so who cares. I too find Deligne's paper
more beautiful than my own formulation. It's just that I did it first,
but apparently if you are not a "mathematician" it does not count.

Bernard Julia response:
I visited Vogel about 9 months ago about his (super)group manifold and
his version of the E line! He is trying to disprove a conjecture of
Deligne in this field.

Here is the general idea of my program, nothing has been published.
The theory of second order Painlev\'e differential ODE is classical. The
definition of difference Painlev\'e equations is not uniformly agreed upon
however but the main one due to Sakai does indeed suggest that my En
series (equivalently that of the Del Pezzo's) correspond to so called
q-difference equations whereas yours (I mean the A0 A1 A2 end) is closer to
those diagrams appearing in additive difference Painlev\'e equations but F4
and G2 are missing today. I urged the experts to look for them and one more
branch appears with A3 symmetry as an important piece. Furthermore I am
trying to clarify  the delicate connection(s) to (continuous) differential
equations and c-Painlev\'e VI takes a leading role there only.
A very small workshop: One day would cover discretizations of
symmetries and of spaces, one day for the characteristic properties of
Painlev\'es (what makes them polyquitous) and one day for algebraic geometry
(curves appear in string theory but also surfaces ...Del Pezzo's...),
Calabi-Yau's etc... but confinement of singularities and the algebraic
entropy criterion of Viallet et al. is very relevant, you may know about
it from another side, QRT maps etc...)

\item[2016-02-07  Predrag]
Never heard of them until today, but there is huge literature on
\HREF{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Del_Pezzo_surface} {Del Pezzo
surfaces}.

I know you no longer work on ``birdtracks" but I thought you might be
interested in my preprint\rf{Westbury15} {\em Extending and quantising
the Vogel plane}. \\

I did try to understand spinors but felt I did not succeed. I posted my
attempt in \arXiv{1007.2579}.

I think the problem with the E7 (and also the E6, F4 D4 series) is that
it does not actually form a series. There is nothing written on this but
this does seem to be the consensus. When I say it is not a series, I
mean you end up with a finite list (so no parameter). This is known to
happen for the G2 series. I wrote an account of this in
\arXiv{1011.6197}

However, I still believe the E8 series exists as Deligne conjectured and
am currently working on proving this. This seems to me to be crucial.

complaining that ``
My only bone is that I do not get how the $E_8$ series that I computed in
a 1977 preprint and officially published in 1981 gets to be called
``Deligne conjecture'' from 1996 on. I explain the history in detail in
birdtracks.eu section 21.2 A BRIEF HISTORY OF EXCEPTIONAL MAGIC. They
have recomputed the same formulas, they know of my work, they mention
that they this ``well known to physicists (cf. Cvitanovi\'c [83]),'' and
that's it. The total credit for what was a wonderful breakthrough for me.
That's neither nice nor professional. Oh, screw them :)

Read

M.~A.~Olshanetskii and V.B.K.~Rogov\rf{Olshanetskii1987}
``Adjoint representations of exceptional Lie algebras,''

MacKay\rf{MacKay05}
{\em Introduction to {Yangian} symmetry in integrable field theory}:
``
This, alongside the appearance of X in \refref{PD96,PCgr} and the
unified R-matrix structure of \refref{Westbury02}, suggests that it might be
interesting to investigate the connection between Yangians and the `magic
square' construction of the exceptional Lie groups.

It should be noted that these are not the only magic triangles of Lie

\item[2016-08-20 Bernard Julia]
Again, citation is not complete but it is a big story with old references
so you might be interested in (see, for example page 2):

Shimizu and Tachikawa\rf{ShiTac16}
{\em Anomaly of strings of {$6d N = (1,0)$} theories}

Looks like one also has to look at
Kim \etal\rf{KiKiPa16} {\em {6d} strings from new chiral gauge theories}

\item[2016-12-03 Predrag]
Reading Shimizu and Tachikawa\rf{ShiTac16}, and in particular their footnote $^1$.
They credit Deligne for ``Deligne's exceptional series of groups,'' and then
they say ``also independently found by Cvitanovi\'c.'' This after reading
section~21.2 of birdtacks book\rf{PCgr}. I do not get the ethics of
mathematicians, they must think it is a town in Russia. If I discover the
series in 1975-77, and Deligne rediscovers almost 20 years
later\rf{PD96}, fully aware that I had discovered it (click
\HREF{http://birdtracks.eu/extras/Deligne96.pdf}{here}), how is that the
``Deligne series?''

They also refer to {1988} Mathur and Mukhi and Sen paper\rf{MaMuSe88},
Table~4 of Beem \etal\rf{BLLPRR15}, and Table~1 of Lemos and
Liendo\rf{LemLie16}. The 2000 paper of Grassi and Morrison\rf{GraMor00}
refers only to Deligne, does not cite me at all.
