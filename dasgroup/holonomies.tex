I recently found a niche for your $E_7$ family\rf{NegDimE7}. Please have a
look at Bryant\rf{Bryant99} and check out \reftab{Bryant99tabIV} in his
review of Berger\rf{Berger55,Berger57} nonmetric holonomies.
You will find among the exotic symplectics \(E_7, D_6, A_5\) (where everybody
agrees), and then your $C_3$, your $3\,A_1$ (as a possible solution) and your
$A_1$.

What do you make of this, except that the symplecticity is just right... ?

I copy this to Pierre <pierre.ramond@gmail.com> who may appreciate.

My 1975 construction\rf{PCar,C77,PCgr} of the $\E_7$ row of the Magic
Triangle was inspired by Brown's\rf{Brown1969} observation that defining
representation of \(E_7\) has a symmetric quartic invariant (my construction,
however, is a stand-alone derivation that owes nothing to Brown and
Freudethal). In my {\em Negative dimensions and $E_7$
symmetry}\rf{NegDimE7} (as well as in Chapter 20. {\em E7 family and its
negative-dimensional cousins} of the birdtracks book\rf{PCgr}) I the
negative-dimension relation through which $E_7$ emerges as a
negative-dimensional relative of $SO(4)$.
As nobody understood my diagrammatic notation, in 1980 I rewrote my (very
compact in diagrammatic notation) derivation of the $\E_7$ family in the more
standard and lengthy index notation\rf{NegDimE7}. That also ended up
blowing in the wind.

My reading Bryant\rf{Bryant99} review paper
{\em Recent advances in the theory of holonomy},
\\ \arXiv{math/9910059}
\\~[arXiv now includes blog links:
\HREF{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holonomy}{wiki/Holonomy}

{\it Exotic Holonomies.}
The full list of exotic holonomies (so called because the were omitted from
the initial list of Berger\rf{Berger57}) was compiled by Chi, Merkulov,
Schwachh\"ofer, and Bryant\rf{ChMeSc96,Bryant87,Bryant91}; see, in
particular, the tables in Merkulov and
Schwachh{\"o}fer\rf{MerSch99,MerSch99add}, and \reftab{Bryant99tabIV} here.

The first two examples in \reftab{Bryant99tabIV}, each with a torsion-free
connection, were analyzed in \refref{Berger57}. The
study\rf{Bryant87,Bryant91} of the moduli space of rational curves on a
complex surface with normal bundle~${\cal O}(3)$ turned up the next two
entries in \reftab{Bryant99tabIV} that were omitted from Berger's nonmetric
list\rf{Bryant91}. The `exotic' refers to any nonmetric
subgroup~$H\subset\GL({\mathfrak m})$ that satisfies Berger's criteria but
that does not appear on Berger's original nonmetric list.
The construction \rf{Bryant91} uncovered a number of unexpected identities.
Chi, Merkulov, and Schwachh\"ofer\rf{ChMeSc96} found other exotic symplectic
examples, and noticed that the reconstruction technique generalized in the
context of Poisson geometry (\ie, Poisson bracket, or a symplectic
skew-symmetric invariant).

% Even for the exceptional holonomies, there are explicit examples of
% cohomogeneity one\rf{Bryant87,BrySal89}.

I am not able to decode any of the ``exotic holonomies'' literature that I
have looked at. Questions to experts:

\begin{description}
  \item[(quartic invariant)]
Is there is a quartic invariant someplace in the Poisson manifolds derivation
of the exotic symplectic holonomies?
  \item[(ternary algebra)]
If not that, can you identify a class of ternary algebras (Freudenthal triple
systems), see Faulkner\rf{Faulkner1971} and Yamaguti and
Asano\rf{Yamaguti1975}.
  \item[($3\,A_1$)]
Is my 8-dimensional representation of semi-simple $3\,A_1$ consistent with your
family of possible symmetries? I have no wiggle room - it must be $\bbR^{8}$.
Would there be something special about that case?
  \item[($\U(1)$)]
Why don't you have $\U(1)  $, $\bbR^{2}$ in your list?
Too trivial for you?
  \item[(supersymmetry)]
Where is the list of supersymmetric partners\rf{MerSch99} to
\reftab{Bryant99tabIV}?
Is
\(\SOn{4} \simeq \SOn{3}\oplus\SOn{3} \simeq A_1\oplus A_1
\)
in such list?
  \item[(exceptional magic)] Would it make you happy to learn that
your `exotic' is a synonym for Cartan-Kylling's `exceptional'\rf{PCgr}?

Merkulov and Schwachh{\"o}fer\rf{MerSch99} note
``
Another by-product result is  the striking supersymmetry property of their
real forms which occur as holonomies of torsion-free affine connections. With
any symplectic Lie algebra $g \subset \Sp(V)$, dim~$g = m$, dim~$V = 2n$, one
may associate naturally an $(m|2n)$-dimensional supermanifold
''

Supersymmetry was actually the motivation for construction of my my $\E_7$
family\rf{NegDimE7}, but I have so far not been able to identify my $\SOn{4}$
family in the above holonomies literature. It might be in this
paper\rf{MerSch99}, for all I know...
