\begin{abstract}
Dynamical systems with translational or rotational symmetry arise
frequently in studies of spatially extended physical systems, such as
Navier-Stokes flows on periodic domains. In these cases, it is natural to
express the state of the fluid in terms of a Fourier series truncated to a
finite number of modes.
Here, we study a 4-dimensional model with chaotic dynamics and
\SOn{2} symmetry similar to those that appear in fluid dynamics problems.
A crucial step in the analysis of such a system
is symmetry reduction. We use the model to illustrate different
symmetry-reduction techniques. Its relative equilibria are conveniently
determined by rewriting the dynamics in terms of a symmetry-invariant
polynomial basis. However, for the analysis of its chaotic dynamics, the `method of
slices', which is applicable to very high-dimensional problems, is
preferable. We show that a Poincar\'e section taken on the `slice' can be
used to further reduce this flow to what is for all practical purposes a
unimodal map. This enables us to systematically determine all relative
periodic orbits and their symbolic dynamics up to any desired period. We
then present cycle averaging formulas adequate for systems with continuous symmetry
and use them to compute dynamical averages using relative periodic orbits. The convergence
of such computations is discussed.

\begin{quotation}
Periodic orbit theory provides a way to compute dynamical averages for
chaotic flows by means of {\cycForm s} that relate the time averages of
observables to the spectra of unstable periodic orbits. Standard
{\cycForm s} are valid under the assumption that the stability
multipliers of all periodic orbits have a single marginal direction
corresponding to time evolution and are hyperbolic in all other
directions. However, if a dynamical system has $N$ continuous symmetries,
periodic orbits are replaced by relative periodic orbits, invariant
$(N+1)$-dimensional tori with marginal stability in $(N+1)$ directions.
Such exact invariant solutions arise in studies of turbulent flows, such
as pipe flow or plane Couette flow, which have continuous symmetries.
In practice, the translational invariance of these flows is approximated in numerical
simulations by using periodic domains so that the state of the fluid
is conveniently expressed as a Fourier series, truncated to a large but finite
number (from tens to thousands) of Fourier modes. This paper is a tutorial on
how such problems can be analyzed using periodic orbit theory. We illustrate
all the necessary steps using a simple `\twomode' model as an example.

\section{Introduction}
\label{s:intro}

Recent experimental observations of traveling waves in pipe flows have
confirmed the intuition from dynamical systems theory that invariant solutions
of \NSe\ play an important role in shaping the \statesp\ of turbulent
flows.\rf{science04} When one casts fluid flow equations in a
particular basis, the outcome is an infinite dimensional dynamical system
that is often equivariant under transformations such as
translations, reflections and rotations. For example, when periodic
boundary conditions are imposed along the streamwise direction, the equations
for pipe flow retain their form under the action of streamwise translations,
azimuthal rotations and reflections about the central axis, \ie, they are equivariant
under the actions of $\SOn{2}\times\On{2}$. In this case it is natural
to express the state of the fluid in a Fourier basis. However,
as the system evolves, the nonlinear terms in the equations mix the
various modes, so that the state of the system evolves not only along the
symmetry directions, but also along directions transverse to them.
This complicates the dynamics and gives rise to high dimensional coherent
solutions such as \reqva\ and \rpo s, which take on the roles played by
\eqva\ and \po s in flows without symmetry.

There is an extensive literature on equivariant dynamics,
which can be traced back to Poincar\'e's work on the 3-body problem.\rf{Poinc1896}
Early references in the modern dynamical systems
literature that we know of are works of Smale,\rf{Smale70I}
Field,\rf{Field70} and Ruelle.\rf{ruell73} Our goal here is not to
provide a comprehensive review of this literature, or study its
techniques in generality. For those, we refer the reader to monographs
by Golubitsky and Stewart,\rf{golubitsky2002sp} and Field.\rf{Field07}
Our aim here is much more modest: We would like to
provide a hands-on introduction to some of the concepts from
equivariant dynamical systems theory, with an emphasis on those aspects
relevant to the application of the periodic orbit theory to these systems. To this end,
we undertake a step-by-step tutorial approach and illustrate each concept on a
\twomode\ \SOn{2} equivariant normal form that has the minimal
dimensionality required for chaotic dynamics. We provide
visualizations of geometrical concepts, whenever possible.
While the example studied here has no physical significance,
such an analysis should ultimately be applicable to numerical solutions of
turbulent flows on periodic domains, once sufficiently many exact
invariant solutions become numerically accessible.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows: In \refsect{s:symm}, we
define basic concepts and briefly review the relevant symmetry reduction
literature. In \refsect{s:twoMode}, we introduce the \twomode\ model
system, discuss several of its symmetry-reduced representations,
and utilize a symmetry-reduced polynomial representation to find the only \reqv\ of the
system.\DB{201-11-15}{I would throw this out, at least as a highlight in the ``review'' of the
paper. Our take-home message is that you could use our approach on turbulent flows, so the
fact that we can cheat by using invariant polynomials shouldn't be celebrated}
In \refsect{s:numerics}, we show how the \mslices\ can be used to
quotient the symmetry and reduce the dynamics onto a symmetry-reduced
\statesp\ or `\slice '. A Poincar\'e section taken on the \slice\ then
reduces the 4\dmn\ chaotic dynamics in the full \statesp\ to an approximately
one-dimensional, unimodal Poincar\'e return map. The return map is then
used to construct a finite grammar symbolic dynamics for the flow and
determine {\em all} \rpo s up to a given period. In \refsect{s:DynAvers},
we present {\cycForm s} adequate for systems with continuous symmetries
and use the relative periodic orbits calculated in \refsect{s:numerics}
to calculate dynamically interesting observables. Finally, in \refsect{s:concl},
we discuss possible applications of the \mslices\ to various spatially
extended systems.

The main text is supplemented by two appendices. \refAppe{s:newton} describes
the multi-shooting method used to calculate the \rpo s.
\refAppe{s:schur} discusses how periodic Schur decomposition can be used
to determine their Floquet multipliers, which can differ by 100s
of orders of magnitude even in a model as simple as the \twomode\ system.
