abstract ={In this review, we summarize the results of our numerical work
carried out over nearly ten years on the complete determination of the
10th-order contribution to the anomalous magnetic moments of leptons in
the perturbation theory of quantum electrodynamics. Our approach is based
on a reorganized renormalization method in which no divergent quantities
appear explicitly in any part of the calculation, which is crucial for
the feasibility of numerical integration. The enormous number of
10th-order diagrams and the complexity of the renormalization procedure
are such that we could not have handled this problem without the
development of an automated code-generating algorithm. The systematic
approach to these problems is described in some detail.},

  pages = {P12011},

	function in statistical models on graphs with loops in terms of the
	Berezin/fermion integrals. The paper focuses on a representation
	of the determinant of a square matrix in terms of a finite series,
	where each term corresponds to a loop on the graph. The representation
	is based on a fermion version of the loop calculus, previously introduced
	by the authors for graphical models with finite alphabets. Our construction
	contains two levels. First, we represent the determinant in terms
	of an integral over anti-commuting Grassmann variables, with some
	reparametrization/gauge freedom hidden in the formulation. Second,
	we show that a special choice of the gauge, called the BP (Bethe-Peierls
	or belief propagation) gauge, yields the desired loop representation.
	The set of gauge fixing BP conditions is equivalent to the Gaussian
	BP equations, discussed in the past as efficient (linear scaling)
	heuristics for estimating the covariance of a sparse positive matrix.}

theorem interprets the Gaussian matrix integral of the products of the
trace of powers of Hermitian matrices as the number of labelled maps with
a given degree sequence, sorted by their Euler characteristics. This
leads to the map enumeration results analogous to those obtained by
combinatorial methods. In this paper we show that the enumeration of the
graphs embeddable on a given 2-dimensional surface (a main research topic
of contemporary enumerative combinatorics) can also be formulated as the
Gaussian matrix integral of an ice-type partition function. Some of the
most puzzling conjectures of discrete mathematics are related to the
notion of the cycle double cover. We express the number of the graphs
with a fixed directed cycle double cover as the Gaussian matrix integral
of an Ihara–Selberg-type function. "

low positive energies can be deduced from the existence of nondegenerate
critical points of an averaged Hamiltonian on an associated `reduced
space.' Alternatively, in classical (kinetic plus potential energy)
Hamiltonians the existence of such orbits can often be established by
elementary geometrical arguments. The present paper unifies the two
approaches by exploiting discrete symmetries, including reversing
diffeomorphisms, that occur in a given system. The symmetries are used to
locate the periodic orbits in the averaged Hamiltonian, and thence in the
original Hamiltonian when the periodic orbits are continued under
perturbations admitting the same symmetries. In applications to the
H\'enon-Heiles Hamiltonian, it is illustrated how `higher order' averaging
can sometimes be used to overcome degeneracies encountered at first
order. "

	are varied. The method is given for an arbitrary Lie group, providing
