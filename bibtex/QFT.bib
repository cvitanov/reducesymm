carried out over nearly ten years on the complete determination of the
10\textsuperscript{th}-order contribution to the anomalous magnetic moments of leptons in
the perturbation theory of quantum electrodynamics. Our approach is based
on a reorganized renormalization method in which no divergent quantities
appear explicitly in any part of the calculation, which is crucial for
the feasibility of numerical integration. The enormous number of
10\textsuperscript{th}-order diagrams and the complexity of the renormalization procedure
are such that we could not have handled this problem without the
development of an automated code-generating algorithm. The systematic
approach to these problems is described in some detail.},

	function in statistical models on graphs with loops in terms of the
	Berezin/fermion integrals. The paper focuses on a representation
	of the determinant of a square matrix in terms of a finite series,
	where each term corresponds to a loop on the graph. The representation
	is based on a fermion version of the loop calculus, previously introduced
	by the authors for graphical models with finite alphabets. Our construction
	contains two levels. First, we represent the determinant in terms
	of an integral over anti-commuting Grassmann variables, with some
	reparametrization/gauge freedom hidden in the formulation. Second,
	we show that a special choice of the gauge, called the BP (Bethe-Peierls
	or belief propagation) gauge, yields the desired loop representation.
	The set of gauge fixing BP conditions is equivalent to the Gaussian
	BP equations, discussed in the past as efficient (linear scaling)
	heuristics for estimating the covariance of a sparse positive matrix.}

low positive energies can be deduced from the existence of nondegenerate
critical points of an averaged Hamiltonian on an associated `reduced
space.' Alternatively, in classical (kinetic plus potential energy)
Hamiltonians the existence of such orbits can often be established by
elementary geometrical arguments. The present paper unifies the two
approaches by exploiting discrete symmetries, including reversing
diffeomorphisms, that occur in a given system. The symmetries are used to
locate the periodic orbits in the averaged Hamiltonian, and thence in the
original Hamiltonian when the periodic orbits are continued under
perturbations admitting the same symmetries. In applications to the
H\'enon-Heiles Hamiltonian, it is illustrated how `higher order' averaging
can sometimes be used to overcome degeneracies encountered at first
order. },

instanton effects in quantum theories, with a focus on large N gauge

effects in the case of ordinary differential equations, which provide a
model for more complicated theories, and I introduce in a pedagogical way
some technology from resurgent analysis, like trans-series and the
resurgent version of the Stokes phenomenon. After reviewing instanton
effects in quantum mechanics and quantum field theory, I address general
aspects of large N instantons, and then present a detailed review of
non-perturbative effects in matrix models. Finally, I consider two
applications of these techniques in string theory.},

	is computationally tractable as well, allowing one to compute self-similar
	solutions by evolving a dynamical system to a steady state, in a
	scaled reference frame where the self-similarity has been factored
	out. More generally, bifurcation techniques can be used to find self-similar
	solutions, and determine their behaviour as parameters in the equations
	are varied. The method is given for an arbitrary Lie group, providing
	equations for the dynamics on the reduced space, for reconstructing
	the full dynamics and for determining the resulting scaling laws
