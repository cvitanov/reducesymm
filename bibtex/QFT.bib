carried out over nearly ten years on the complete determination of the
10\textsuperscript{th}-order contribution to the anomalous magnetic moments of leptons in
the perturbation theory of quantum electrodynamics. Our approach is based
on a reorganized renormalization method in which no divergent quantities
appear explicitly in any part of the calculation, which is crucial for
the feasibility of numerical integration. The enormous number of
10\textsuperscript{th}-order diagrams and the complexity of the renormalization procedure
are such that we could not have handled this problem without the
development of an automated code-generating algorithm. The systematic
approach to these problems is described in some detail.}

  abstract = {The classical field theories that underlie the quantum
treatments of the electromagnetic, weak, and strong forces share a
peculiar feature: specifying the initial state of the field determines
the evolution of some degrees of freedom of the theory while leaving the
evolution of some others wholly arbitrary. This strongly suggests that
some of the variables of the standard state space lack physical
content---intuitively, the space of states of such a theory is of higher
dimension than the corresponding space of genuine physical possibilities.
The structure of such theories can helpfully be characterized in terms of
the action of symmetry groups on their space of states; and the
conceptual problems surrounding their strange behavior can be sharpened
in light of the observation that it is usually possible to eliminate the
redundant variables associated with these symmetries---which turn out to be
precisely those variables whose evolution is unconstrained by the
dynamical laws of the theory. This paper discusses this approach, uses it
to frame questions about the interpretation of classical gauge theories,
and to reflect (pessimistically) on our prospects of reaching
satisfactory answers to these questions. },

	function in statistical models on graphs with loops in terms of the

	of the determinant of a square matrix in terms of a finite series,
	where each term corresponds to a loop on the graph. The representation
	is based on a fermion version of the loop calculus, previously introduced
	by the authors for graphical models with finite alphabets. Our construction
	contains two levels. First, we represent the determinant in terms
	of an integral over anti-commuting Grassmann variables, with some
	reparametrization/gauge freedom hidden in the formulation. Second,
	we show that a special choice of the gauge, called the BP (Bethe-Peierls
	or belief propagation) gauge, yields the desired loop representation.
	The set of gauge fixing BP conditions is equivalent to the Gaussian
	BP equations, discussed in the past as efficient (linear scaling)
	heuristics for estimating the covariance of a sparse positive matrix.}

low positive energies can be deduced from the existence of nondegenerate
critical points of an averaged Hamiltonian on an associated `reduced
space.' Alternatively, in classical (kinetic plus potential energy)
Hamiltonians the existence of such orbits can often be established by
elementary geometrical arguments. The present paper unifies the two
approaches by exploiting discrete symmetries, including reversing
diffeomorphisms, that occur in a given system. The symmetries are used to
locate the periodic orbits in the averaged Hamiltonian, and thence in the
original Hamiltonian when the periodic orbits are continued under
perturbations admitting the same symmetries. In applications to the
H\'enon-Heiles Hamiltonian, it is illustrated how `higher order' averaging
can sometimes be used to overcome degeneracies encountered at first
order. }

theorem interprets the Gaussian matrix integral of the products of the
trace of powers of Hermitian matrices as the number of labelled maps with
a given degree sequence, sorted by their Euler characteristics. This
leads to the map enumeration results analogous to those obtained by
combinatorial methods. In this paper we show that the enumeration of the
graphs embeddable on a given 2-dimensional surface (a main research topic
of contemporary enumerative combinatorics) can also be formulated as the
Gaussian matrix integral of an ice-type partition function. Some of the
most puzzling conjectures of discrete mathematics are related to the
notion of the cycle double cover. We express the number of the graphs
with a fixed directed cycle double cover as the Gaussian matrix integral
of an Ihara--Selberg-type function. }

	involves separating the dynamics on the shape space (which determines

	is computationally tractable as well, allowing one to compute self-similar
	solutions by evolving a dynamical system to a steady state, in a
	scaled reference frame where the self-similarity has been factored
	out. More generally, bifurcation techniques can be used to find self-similar
	solutions, and determine their behaviour as parameters in the equations
	are varied. The method is given for an arbitrary Lie group, providing
	equations for the dynamics on the reduced space, for reconstructing
	the full dynamics and for determining the resulting scaling laws
	for self-similar solutions. We illustrate the technique with a numerical
	example, computing self-similar solutions of the Burgers equation}

  abstract={The Gribov copies and their consequences on the infrared
  behavior of the gluon propagator are investigated in euclidean
  Yang-Mills theories quantized in linear covariant gauges. Considering
  small values of the gauge parameter, it turns out that the transverse
  component of the gluon propagator is suppressed, while its longitudinal
  part is left unchanged. A Green function which
  displays infrared enhancement and which reduces to the ghost propagator
  in the Landau gauge is identified. The inclusion of the dimension two
  gluon condensate is also considered. In this case, the transverse component of
  the gluon propagator and the Green function  remain
  suppressed and enhanced, respectively. Moreover, the longitudinal part
  of the gluon propagator becomes suppressed. A comparison with the
  results obtained from the studies of the Schwinger-Dyson equations and
  from lattice simulations is provided.}
