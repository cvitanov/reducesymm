    broadened laser demonstrate that the form of the return map of successive
    peak values of the intensity changes from a sharply cusped map in
    resonance to a map with a smoothly rounded maximum as the laser is
    detuned into the period doubling regime. This transformation appears
    to be related to the disappearance (with detuning) of the heteroclinic
    structural basis for the stable manifold which exists in resonance.
    This is in contrast to the evidence reported by Tang and Weiss (Phys.
    Rev. A 49 (1994) 1296) of a cusped map for both the period doubling
    chaos found with detuning and the spiral chaos found in resonance
    for seemingly Lorenz-like behavior of the far-infrared ammonia laser
    from which it was concluded that there existed a ?unique chaotic
    attractor for a single-mode laser?. }

  pages = {303--341},
  abstract = {We develop and test two novel computational approaches for predicting
    the mean linear response of a chaotic dynamical system to small change
    in external forcing via the fluctuation-dissipation theorem. Unlike
    the earlier work in developing fluctuation-dissipation theorem-type
    computational strategies for chaotic nonlinear systems with forcing
    and dissipation, the new methods are based on the theory of Sinai-Ruelle-Bowen
    probability measures, which commonly describe the equilibrium state
    of such dynamical systems. The new methods take into account the
    fact that the dynamics of chaotic nonlinear forced-dissipative systems
    often reside on chaotic fractal attractors, where the classical quasi-Gaussian
    formula of the fluctuation-dissipation theorem often fails to produce
    satisfactory response prediction, especially in dynamical regimes
    with weak and moderate degrees of chaos. A simple new low-dimensional
    chaotic nonlinear forced-dissipative model is used to study the response
    of both linear and nonlinear functions to small external forcing
    in a range of dynamical regimes with an adjustable degree of chaos.
    We demonstrate that the two new methods are remarkably superior to
    the classical fluctuation-dissipation formula with quasi-Gaussian
    approximation in weakly and moderately chaotic dynamical regimes,
    for both linear and nonlinear response functions. One straightforward
    algorithm gives excellent results for short-time response while the
    other algorithm, based on systematic rational approximation, improves
    the intermediate and long time response predictions.},

    equations. Our controller design methodology is based on the linearization
    of the reduced equations about such fixed points. We present two
    different approaches of control design. The first approach assumes
    that the closed loop system is affine in the control and that the
    actuation is equivariant. We derive feedback laws for the reduced
    system that minimize a quadratic cost function. The second approach
    is more general; here the actuation need not be equivariant, but
    the actuators can be translated in the symmetry direction. The controller
    resulting from this approach leaves the dynamics associated with
    the symmetry variable unchanged. Both approaches are simple to implement,
    as they use standard tools available from linear control theory.
    We illustrate the approaches on three examples: a rotationally invariant
    planar {ODE,} an inverted pendulum on a cart, and the {Kuramoto-Sivashinsky}
    equation with periodic boundary conditions.}

    1,000,000 periodic orbits that have no more than 20 collisions. We
    also compute some statistical quantities of the resultant periodic
    orbits. In these statistics, we observe a periodic peak structure
    that survives pruning; that is, it possesses a "pruning-proof property".}

    family of normally hyperbolic relative equilibria can change character
    at what we call a `drift bifurcation'. To do this, we use results
    of Arnold to analyse parametrized families of elements in the Lie
    algebra of the symmetry group. We examine effects in physical space
    of such drift bifurcations for planar reaction-diffusion systems
    and note that these effects can explain certain aspects of the transition
    from rigidly rotating spirals to rigidly propagating `retracting
    waves'. This is a bifurcation observed in numerical simulations of
    excitable media where the rotation rate of a family of spirals slows
    down and gives way to a semi-infinite translating wavefront.}

  pages = {199--219},
  abstract = {A rigorous proof is given in the standard map for the existence of
    chaotic trajectories with unbounded momenta for large enough coupling
    constant k. The obtained chaotic trajectories correspond to stationary
    configurations of the Frenkel-Kontorowa model with a finite (non-zero)
    photon gap (called gap parameter in dimensionless units). This property
    implies that the trajectory (or the configuration {ui}) can be uniquely
    continued as a uniformly continuous function of the model parameter
    k in some neighborhood of the initial configuration. A non-zero gap
    parameter implies that the Lyapunov coefficient is strictly positive
    (when it is defined). In addition, the existence of dilating and
    contracting manifolds is proven for these chaotic trajectories. ``Exotic''?
    trajectories such as ballistic trajectories are also proven to exist
    as a consequence of these theorems. The concept of anti-integrability
    emerges from these theorems. In the anti-integrable limit which can
    be only defined for a discrete time dynamical system, the coordinates
    of the trajectory at time i do not depend on the coordinates at time
    i - 1. Thus, at this singular limit, the existence of chaotic trajectories
    is trivial and the dynamical system reduces to a Bernoulli shift.
    It appears that the chaotic trajectories of dynamical systems originate
    by continuity from those which exists at the anti-integrable limits.},

symmetric periodic orbits in Hamiltonian systems of two degrees of
freedom. The method is based on the classical search method but combining
up-to-date numerical algorithms in the search and in the integration
process. Instead of using Newton methods that requires to differentiate
the Poincar\' map we use the Brent?s method and in the integration process
a Taylor series method that permits us to compute the orbits using
extended precision, something highly interesting in the case of unstable
periodic orbits. These facts have permitted us to obtain many more
periodic orbits than other researchers. Once the families of periodic
orbits have been found we study the bifurcations just by comparing with
the stability index and the classical generic bifurcations for
Hamiltonian systems with and without symmetries. We illustrate the method
with four important classical Hamiltonian problems. "

of periodic orbits in two-degrees of freedom Hamiltonian systems, which
provide rigorous skeletons of periodic orbits. To that goal we show how
to prove the existence and stability of a huge set of discrete initial
conditions of periodic orbits, and later, how to prove the existence and
stability of continuous families of periodic orbits. We illustrate the
approach with two paradigmatic problems: the Hénon-Heiles Hamiltonian and

    This kinetic effect is studied at normal and oblique laser beam incidence
    and particle injection by a test particle approach in an energy interval
    extending into the relativistic domain. Three main results obtained
    are the strong dependence of the energy gain by the single particle
    on the instant of injection relative to the phase of the light wave,
    the reflection of the particles primarily contributing to absorption
    well in front of the target rather than in the Debye layer, and the
    low degree of absorption hardly exceeding the 10\% limit. The simulation
    results offer a more unambiguous interpretation of the absorption
    mechanism often referred to as ?vacuum heating.? In particular, it
    is clearly revealed that the absorption in the vacuum region prevails
    on that originating from the skin layer. Relativistic ponderomotive
    effects are also tested, however their contribution to absorption
    is not significant.},

abstract = "The classical field theories that underlie the quantum
treatments of the electromagnetic, weak, and strong forces share a
peculiar feature: specifying the initial state of the field determines
the evolution of some degrees of freedom of the theory while leaving the
evolution of some others wholly arbitrary. This strongly suggests that
some of the variables of the standard state space lack physical
content?intuitively, the space of states of such a theory is of higher
dimension than the corresponding space of genuine physical possibilities.
The structure of such theories can helpfully be characterized in terms of
the action of symmetry groups on their space of states; and the
conceptual problems surrounding their strange behavior can be sharpened
in light of the observation that it is usually possible to eliminate the
redundant variables associated with these symmetries?which turn out to be
precisely those variables whose evolution is unconstrained by the
dynamical laws of the theory. This paper discusses this approach, uses it
to frame questions about the interpretation of classical gauge theories,
and to reflect (pessimistically) on our prospects of reaching
satisfactory answers to these questions. "

theory is developed for slowly varying fully nonlinear wavetrains (i.e.
solutions which appear locally as travelling waves, but with frequencies
and wavelengths which may vary widely on long length and time scales).
This perturbation theory is applied to the Ginzburg-Landau equation. The
motion and stability of slowly varying wavetrains is shown to be governed
by a simple wave equation which can develop shocks corresponding to rapid
changes in wavenumber. Numerical results supporting this theory are
presented. A shock structure is proposed and numerically verified. These
results together with a winding invariant valid in the limit of slow
variation suggest that over a large range of parameters many initial
conditions relax to uniform wavetrains. The evolution of a marginally
diffusively stable wavetrain is also examined; it is argued that the
evolution is governed by a perturbed Korteweg-de Vries equation. "

    symmetries and in addition be useful for the application of other
    mathematical methods. From symmetries or multipliers for conservation
    laws, one can determine whether or not a given system of differential
    equations can be linearized by an invertible transformation.}

    energies in the multi-kiloelectronvolt range?two orders of magnitude

    is relative equilibria. In this paper the nonlinear problem near
    a degenerate relative equilibrium is considered. The degeneracy creates
    a saddle-center and attendant homoclinic bifurcation in the reduced
    system transverse to the group orbit. The surprising result is that
    the curvature of the pullback of the momentum map to the Lie algebra
    determines the normal form for the homoclinic bifurcation. There
    is also an induced directional geometric phase in the homoclinic
    bifurcation. The backbone of the analysis is the use of singularity
    theory for smooth mappings between manifolds applied to the pullback
    of the momentum map. The theory is constructive and generalities
    are given for symmetric Hamiltonian systems on a vector space of
    dimension (2n+2) with an n-dimensional abelian symmetry group. Examples
    for n=1,2,3 are presented to illustrate application of the theory.}

    functions on the state space to: (a) identify invariant sets in the
    state space, and (b) to form coherent structures by aggregating invariant
    sets that are similar across multiple spatial scales. First, we construct
    the ergodic quotient, the object obtained by mapping trajectories
    to the space of the trajectory averages of a function basis on the
    state space. Second, we endow the ergodic quotient with a metric
    structure that successfully captures how similar the invariant sets
    are in the state space. Finally, we parametrize the ergodic quotient
    using intrinsic diffusion modes on it. By segmenting the ergodic
    quotient based on the diffusion modes, we extract coherent features
    in the state space of the dynamical system. The algorithm is validated
    by analyzing the Arnold-Beltrami-Childress flow, which was the test-bed
    for alternative approaches: the Ulam's approximation of the transfer
    operator and the computation of Lagrangian Coherent Structures. Furthermore,
    we explain how the method extends the Poincar\'e map analysis for
    periodic flows. As a demonstration, we apply the method to a periodically-driven
    three-dimensional Hill's vortex flow, discovering unknown coherent
    structures in its state space.},

  abstract = { The chaotic dynamics of Alfv\'en waves in space plasmas governed
    by the derivative nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation, in the low-dimensional
    limit described by stationary spatial solutions, is studied. A bifurcation
    diagram is constructed, by varying the driver amplitude, to identify
    a number of nonlinear dynamical processes including saddle-node bifurcation,
    boundary crisis, and interior crisis. The roles played by unstable
    periodic orbits and chaotic saddles in these transitions are analyzed,
    and the conversion from a chaotic saddle to a chaotic attractor in
    these dynamical processes is demonstrated. In particular, the phenomenon
    of gap-filling in the chaotic transition from weak chaos to strong
    chaos via an interior crisis is investigated. A coupling unstable
    periodic orbit created by an explosion, within the gaps of the chaotic
    saddles embedded in a chaotic attractor following an interior crisis,
    is found numerically. The gap-filling unstable periodic orbits are
    responsible for coupling the banded chaotic saddle (BCS) to the surrounding
    chaotic saddle (SCS), leading to crisis-induced intermittency. The
    physical relevance of chaos for Alfv\'en intermittent turbulence
    observed in the solar wind is discussed. },

    to their ability to characterize systems out of thermodynamic equilibrium.
    The computation of orthogonal Gram-Schmidt vectors requires multiplication
    and \{QR\} decomposition of large matrices, which grow as N 2 (with
    the particle count). This expense has limited such calculations to
    relatively small systems and short time scales. Here, we detail two
    implementations of an algorithm for computing Gram-Schmidt vectors.
    The first is a distributed-memory message-passing method using Scalapack.
    The second uses the newly-released \{MAGMA\} library for GPUs. We
    compare the performance of both codes for Lennard-Jones fluids from
    N = 100 to 1300 between Intel Nahalem/Infiniband \{DDR\} and \{NVIDIA\}
    \{C2050\} architectures. To our best knowledge, these are the largest
    systems for which the Gram-Schmidt Lyapunov vectors have been computed,
    and the first time their calculation has been GPU-accelerated. We
    conclude that Lyapunov vector calculations can be significantly extended
    in length and time by leveraging the power of GPU-accelerated linear
    algebra.},

    is utilized so that the zeta functions may be approximately expressed
    in terms of the probability distribution of laminar lengths. In particular
    we study a one-parameter family of weights. Depending on the parameter
    the trace can be dominated by branch cuts in the zeta function or
    by isolated zeros. In the former case the time dependence of the
    trace is dominated by a power law and in the latter case by an exponential.
    A phase transition occurs when the leading zero collides with a branch
    cut. The family considered is relevant for the calculation of resonance
    spectra, semiclassical spectra and topological entropy.},

  abstract = {We consider the computation of the eigenvalues of the evolution operator-the
    resonance spectrum-by means of the zeros of a zeta function. In particular
    we address the problems of applying this formalism to bound chaotic
    systems, caused by e.g. intermittency and non-completeness of the
    symbolic dynamics. For bound intermittent systems we derive an approximation
    of the zeta function. With the aid of this zeta function it is argued
    that bound systems with long time tails have branch cuts in the zeta
    function and traces (of the evolution operator) approaching unity
    as a power law. We also show that the dominant time scale can be
    much longer than the period of the shortest periodic orbit, as is,
    for example, the case for the hyperbola billiard. Isolated zeros
    of the zeta function for the hyperbola billiard are evaluated by
    means of a cycle expansion. Crucial for the success of this approach
    is the identification of a sequence of periodic orbit responsible
    for a logarithmic branch cut in the zeta function. Semiclassical
    implications are briefly discussed.},

    conditions in the case of low-dimensional behavior. We analyze the
    bifurcations that occur in a six-dimensional {(6D)} approximation
    of its inertial manifold. We mainly focus on the attracting and structurally
    stable heteroclinic connections that arise for these parameter values.
    We reanalyze the ones that were previously described via a {4D} reduction
    to the center-unstable manifold {(Ambruster} et al., 1988, 1989).
    We also find a parameter region for which a manifold of structurally
    stable heteroclinic cycles exist. The existence of such a manifold
    is responsible for an intermittent behavior which has some features
    of unpredictability.},

the Kuramoto?Sivashinsky equation (KSe) is undertaken from a dynamical
systems? point of view. A recently devised variational method is employed
and one new variant is developed. At fixed system size L = 43.5 ,
important equilibria are identified and shown to organize the dynamics.
The first integral of the steady \{KSe\} leads to a 3D dynamical system
with an integration constant c. At a typical value of c = 0.40194 , four
simplest cycles are identified and used as basic building blocks to
construct longer cycles. The symbolic dynamics based on trajectory
topology are very effective in classifying all short periodic orbits. The
probation of the return map on a chosen Poincar\'e section shows the
complexity of the dynamics and the bifurcation of building blocks
provides a chart to look for possible cycles at given periods. The
current study may be conveniently adapted to the identification and
classification of cycles in other nonlinear systems. "

    theoretical work, however, has identified a new interaction regime
    in which dense electron nanobunches are formed at the plasma?vacuum
    boundary resulting in coherent {XUV} radiation by coherent synchrotron
    emission ({CSE).} Our experiments enable the isolation of {CSE} from

    does indeed occur. We observe spectra with the characteristic spectral
    signature of {CSE?a} slow decay of intensity, I, with high-harmonic
    order, n, as I(n) n?1.62 before a rapid efficiency rollover. Particle-in-cell
    code simulations reveal how dense nanobunches of electrons are periodically
    formed and accelerated during normal-incidence interactions with
    ultrathin foils and result in {CSE} in the transmitted direction.
    This observation of {CSE} presents a route to high-energy {XUV} pulses
    and offers a new window on understanding ultrafast energy coupling

case, the existence of a symmetry no longer implies the existence of an
invariant. Conversely, a map with an invariant need not have a symmetry.
We show that when a symmetry flow has a global Poincaré section there are
coordinates in which the map takes a reduced, skew-product form, and
hence allows for reduction of dimensionality. We show that the reduction
of a volume-preserving map again is volume preserving. Finally we sharpen
the Noether theorem for symplectic maps. A number of illustrative
examples are discussed and the method is compared with traditional
reduction techniques.} }

    flights},
  journal = {Nonlinearity},
  year = {2004},
  volume = {17},
  pages = {1867},
  abstract = {A traditional subject in statistical physics is the linear response
    of a molecular dynamical system to changes in an external forcing
    agency, e.g. the Ohmic response of an electrical conductor to an
    applied electric field. For molecular systems the linear response
    matrices, such as the electrical conductivity, can be represented
    by Green-Kubo formulae as improper time-integrals of 2-time correlation
    functions in the system. Recently, Ruelle has extended the Green-Kubo
    formalism to describe the statistical, steady-state response of a
    'sufficiently chaotic' nonlinear dynamical system to changes in its
    parameters. This formalism potentially has a number of important
    applications. For instance, in studies of global warming one wants
    to calculate the response of climate-mean temperature to a change
    in the atmospheric concentration of greenhouse gases. In general,
    a climate sensitivity is defined as the linear response of a long-time
    average to changes in external forces. We show that Ruelle's linear
    response formula can be computed by an ensemble adjoint technique
    and that this algorithm is equivalent to a more standard ensemble
    adjoint method proposed by Lea, Allen and Haine to calculate climate
    sensitivities. In a numerical implementation for the 3-variable,
    chaotic Lorenz model it is shown that the two methods perform very
    similarly. However, because of a power-law tail in the histogram
    of adjoint gradients their sum over ensemble members becomes a L?vy
    flight , and the central limit theorem breaks down. The law of large
    numbers still holds and the ensemble-average converges to the desired
    sensitivity, but only very slowly, as the number of samples is increased.
    We discuss the implications of this example more generally for ensemble
    adjoint techniques and for the important practical issue of calculating
    climate sensitivities.},

Abstract = {Prequantum dynamics was introduced in the 70s by
Kostant, Souriau and Kirillov as an intermediate between
classical and quantum dynamics. In common with the classical
dynamics, prequantum dynamics transports functions on phase
space, but adds some phases which are important in quantum
interference effects. In the case of hyperbolic dynamical
systems, it is believed that the study of the prequantum
dynamics will give a better understanding of the quantum
interference effects for large time, and of their statistical
properties. We consider a linear hyperbolic map which generates
a chaotic dynamical system on
the torus. The dynamics is lifted to a prequantum fiber bundle.
This gives a unitary prequantum (partially hyperbolic) map. We
calculate its resonances and show that they are related to the
quantum eigenvalues. A remarkable consequence is that quantum
dynamics emerges from long-term behavior of prequantum
dynamics. We present trace formulas, and discuss perspectives
of this approach in the nonlinear case.}

    from medicine and biology to high-energy physics. The accelerating
    fields in conventional accelerators are limited to a few tens of
    {MeV} m-1, owing to material breakdown at the walls of the structure.
    Thus, the production of energetic particle beams currently requires
    large-scale accelerators and expensive infrastructures. Laser?plasma
    accelerators have been proposed as a next generation of compact accelerators
    because of the huge electric fields they can sustain ({\textgreater}100
    {GeV} m-1). However, it has been difficult to use them efficiently
    for applications because they have produced poor-quality particle
    beams with large energy spreads, owing to a randomization of electrons
    in phase space. Here we demonstrate that this randomization can be
    suppressed and that the quality of the electron beams can be dramatically
    enhanced. Within a length of 3 mm, the laser drives a plasma bubble
    that traps and accelerates plasma electrons. The resulting electron
    beam is extremely collimated and quasi-monoenergetic, with a high
    charge of 0.5 {nC} at 170 {MeV.}},

  abstract = {{This work comprises a general study of symmetry breaking for compact
    Lie groups in the context of equivariant bifurcation theory. We start
    by extending the theory developed by Field and Richardson {[}37]
    for absolutely irreducible representations of finite groups to general
    irreducible representations of compact Lie groups. In particular,
    we allow for branches of relative equilibria and phenomena such as
    the Hopf bifurcation. We also present a general theory of determinacy
    for irreducible Lie group actions along the lines previously described
    in Field {[}29]. In the main result of this work, we show that branching
    patterns for generic equivariant bifurcation problems defined on
    irreducible representations persist under perturbations by sufficiently
    high order non-equivariant terms. We give applications of this result
    to normal form computations yielding, for example, equivariant Hopf
    bifurcations and show how normal form computations of branching and
    stabilities are valid when we take account of the non-normalized
    tail.}}

    problems of nonlinear science in both numerical computations and
    experimental measures. In this paper, a new method is proposed to
    detect the UPOs in a non-Lyapunov way. Firstly three special techniques
    are added to quantum-behaved particle swarm optimization (QPSO),
    a novel mbest particle, contracting the searching space self-adaptively
    and boundaries restriction (NCB), then the new method NCB--QPSO is
    proposed. It can maintain an effective search mechanism with fine
    equilibrium between exploitation and exploration. Secondly, the problems
    of detecting the UPOs are converted into a non-negative functions'
    minimization through a proper translation in a non-Lyapunov way.
    Thirdly the simulations to 6 benchmark optimization problems and
    different high order UPOs of 5 classic nonlinear maps are done by
    the proposed method. And the results show that NCB--QPSO is a successful
    method in detecting the UPOs, and it has the advantages of fast convergence,
    high precision and robustness.},

  abstract = {Laser-driven accelerators, in which particles are accelerated by the
    electric field of a plasma wave (the wakefield) driven by an intense
    laser, have demonstrated accelerating electric fields of hundreds
    of {GV} m-1 (refs 1?3). These fields are thousands of times greater
    than those achievable in conventional radio-frequency accelerators,
    spurring interest in laser accelerators as compact next-generation
    sources of energetic electrons and radiation. To date, however, acceleration
    distances have been severely limited by the lack of a controllable
    method for extending the propagation distance of the focused laser
    pulse. The ensuing short acceleration distance results in low-energy
    beams with 100 per cent electron energy spread, which limits potential
    applications. Here we demonstrate a laser accelerator that produces
    electron beams with an energy spread of a few per cent, low emittance
    and increased energy (more than 109 electrons above 80 {MeV).} Our
    technique involves the use of a preformed plasma density channel
    to guide a relativistically intense laser, resulting in a longer
    propagation distance. The results open the way for compact and tunable
    high-brightness sources of electrons and radiation.},

dynamics with local confinement, in which interactions between
neighboring particles occur through hard core elastic
collisions. Such dynamics may be described as high-dimensional
billiards. We consider the case where the collisions are rare
and, for large systems, derive a Boltzmann-like equation for
the evolution of the probability densities. We solve this
equation in the linear regime and compute the heat conductivity
in the approximate stationary state and with the help of the
Green-Kubo formula. We demonstrate the validity of the
molecular chaos hypothesis by comparing our theoretical
predictions to the results of numerical simulations performed
on a new class of models, which are defocusing chaotic
billiards, likened to higher-dimensional stadia.},

    with a finite stirring region undergoing chaotic advection. We study
    the homogenization of dye in two variants of an eggbeater stirring
    protocol that differ in the extent of their mixing region. In the
    first case, the mixing region is separated from the side walls of
    the channel, while in the second it extends to the walls. For the
    first case, we observe the onset of a permanent concentration pattern
    that repeats over time with decaying intensity. A quantitative analysis
    of the concentration field of dye confirms the convergence to a self-similar
    pattern, akin to the strange eigenmodes previously observed in closed
    flows. We model this phenomenon using an idealized map, where an
    analysis of the mixing dynamics explains the convergence to an eigenmode.
    In contrast, for the second case the presence of no-slip walls and
    separation points on the frontier of the mixing region leads to non-self-similar
    mixing dynamics.}

  abstract = {The theory of chaotic dynamical systems gives many tools that can
    be used in climate studies. The widely used ones are the Lyapunov
    exponents, the Kolmogorov entropy and the attractor dimension characterizing
    global quantities of a system. Another potentially useful tool from
    dynamical system theory arises from the fact that the local analysis
    of a system probability distribution function (PDF) can be accomplished
    by using a procedure that involves an expansion in terms of unstable
    periodic orbits (UPOs). The system measure (or its statistical characteristics)
    is approximated as a weighted sum over the orbits. The weights are
    inversely proportional to the orbit instability characteristics so
    that the least unstable orbits make larger contributions to the PDF.
    Consequently, one can expect some relationship between the least
    unstable orbits and the local maxima of the system PDF. As a result,
    the most probable system trajectories (or `circulation regimes' in
    some sense) may be explained in terms of orbits. For the special
    classes of chaotic dynamical systems, there is a strict theory guaranteeing
    the accuracy of this approach. However, a typical atmospheric model
    may not qualify for these theorems. In our study, we will try to
    apply the idea of UPO expansion to the simple atmospheric system
    based on the barotropic vorticity equation of the sphere. We will
    check how well orbits approximate the system attractor, its statistical
    characteristics and PDF. The connection of the most probable states
    of the system with the least unstable periodic orbits will also be
    analysed.},

  abstract = {Unstable periodic trajectories of a chaotic dissipative system belong
    to the attractor of the system and are its important characteristics.
    Many chaotic systems have an infinite number of periodic solutions
    forming the skeleton of the system attractor. This allows one to
    approximate the system trajectories and statistical characteristics
    by using periodic solutions. The least unstable orbits may generate
    local maxima of the system state distribution functions on the attractor.
    With respect to atmospheric systems this means that orbits may determine
    dynamic circulation regimes and typical variability modes of the
    system. In some cases, given a small number of periodic solutions,
    one can describe the dynamics on the attractor of the system and
    the basic statistics with sufficient precision. Thus, the information
    concerning periodic trajectories of a particular dynamic system may
    be very important for analysis of its behavior. A search for periodic
    trajectories is reduced to the solution of a system of nonlinear
    equations with respect to the initial condition of an orbit and its
    period. The choice of a numerical solution method and an initial
    guess is an important aspect here. In this paper we consider the
    problem of the calculation of periodic trajectories for a barotropic
    model of the atmosphere. Several methods for determination of periodic
    orbits of the model are formulated and implemented, including the
    Newton method with step suppression, the Newton method with a second
    order tensor correction, the quasi-Newton method with step suppression,
    the quasi-Newton method with minimization of the error functional
    and approximate Hessian inversion by the LBFG scheme and the GMRES
    method. A comparison of the efficiency of these numerical methods
    and different choices of initial conditions is performed. Various
    factors influencing the rate of convergence of the methods are considered.},

    and longest-standing problems in fluid dynamics. Stability theory
    suggests that the flow remains laminar for all flow rates, but in
    practice pipe flow becomes turbulent even at moderate speeds. This
    transition drastically affects the transport efficiency of mass,
    momentum, and heat. On the basis of the recent discovery of unstable
    traveling waves in computational studies of the Navier-Stokes equations
    and ideas from dynamical systems theory, a model for the transition
    process has been suggested. We report experimental observation of
    these traveling waves in pipe flow, confirming the proposed transition
    scenario and suggesting that the dynamics associated with these unstable
    states may indeed capture the nature of fluid turbulence.}

Journal = {Taiwanese J. Math.},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {14},
Pages = {825-837},
Abstract = {{The Rayleigh-Ritz-type approach of the contour integral (CIRR)
   eigensolver is extended to be generally applicable to non-Hermitian
   systems. The CIRR method can extract only the eigenvalues in a given
   domain, which was previously formulated for non-degenerated Hermitian
   systems. In this method, the Ritz space for the domain is constructed by
   numerical evaluation of a contour integral. The effect of the numerical
   approximation is analyzed from the viewpoint of a filter operator, which
   supports the use of moderate approximations. The numerical accuracy of

    dynamics of nonhyperbolic chaotic 2-D maps and 3-flows is presented.
    Noise in these systems can have dramatic effects on the invariant
    measure of the system. In regions of homoclinic tangencies perturbations
    are transported away from the neighborhood of the attractor, leading
    to deformations which can be one to two orders of magnitude larger
    than the noise level. A qualitative understanding is attained by
    a study of the universal properties of the unstable and stable foliation
    of the phase space in the vicinity of homoclinic tangencies. Through
    the investigation of nontrivial structures of the tangent space at
    homoclinic tangencies related to the non-normal Jacobians we obtain
    a quantitative description of these noise-induced deformations of
    the attractor. Local expansion rates which are much larger than the
    maximal Lyapunov exponent can be used as a measure of the system's
    structural instability under perturbations. We exemplify our general
    results on the {H\'enon}, Ikeda and Duffing system. A new and effective
    algorithm to calculate the homoclinic tangencies in the entire phase
    space based on the results of this paper is presented.},

    or co-exploding with the evolving solution) leads to improved accuracy
    because of the smaller time derivative in the new spatial frame.
    The slower time behavior permits the use of projective and coarse
    projective integration with longer projective steps in the computation
    of the time evolution of partial differential equations and multiscale
    systems, respectively. These methods are also demonstrated to be
    effective for systems which only approximately or asymptotically
    possess continuous symmetries. The ideas of projective integration
    in a co-evolving frame are illustrated on the one-dimensional, translationally
    invariant Nagumo partial differential equation {(PDE).} A corresponding
    kinetic Monte Carlo model, motivated from the Nagumo kinetics, is
    used to illustrate the coarse-grained method. A simple, one-dimensional
    diffusion problem is used to illustrate the scale invariant case.
    The efficiency of projective integration in the co-evolving frame
    for both the macroscopic diffusion {PDE} and for a random-walker

    periodic orbits (UPOs) is used to develop a method of an a priori
    estimate of the sensitivity of statistical averages of the solution
    to small external influences. This method allows us to determine
    the forcing perturbation which maximizes the norm of the perturbation
    of a statistical moment of the solution on the attractor. The method
    was applied to the Lorenz model. The estimates of perturbations of
    two statistical moments were compared with directly calculated values.
    The comparison shows that some 100 UPOs are sufficient to realize
    this approach and get a good accuracy. The linear approach remains
    valid up to rather high norms of the forcing perturbation.},

    So far no explanation has been substantiated to rationalize the transition
    process by which the steady unidirectional laminar flow state gives
    way to a temporally and spatially disordered three-dimensional (turbulent)
    solution as the flow rate increases. Recently, new travelling wave
    solutions have been discovered which are saddle points in phase space.
    These plausibly represent the lowest level in a hierarchy of spatio-temporal
    periodic flow solutions which may be used to construct a cycle expansion
    theory of turbulent pipe flows. We summarize this success against
    the backdrop of past work and discuss its implications for future

    equation as a model problem we discuss the {K-L} decomposition for

    two modes of using the {K-L} decomposition: As an analytic and synthetic
    tool respectively. Using the analytic mode we find unstable fixed
    points and stable and unstable manifolds in a parameter regime with
    structurally stable homoclinic orbits (a=17.75). Choosing the data
    for a {K-L} analysis carefully by restricting them to certain burst
    events, we can analyze a more complicated intermittent regime at
    a=68. We establish that the spatially localized oscillations around
    a so called `strange' fixed point which are considered as fore-runners
    of spatially concentrated zones of turbulence are in fact created
    by a very specific limit cycle (a=83.75) which, for a=87, bifurcates
    into a modulated traveling wave. Using the {K-L} decomposition synthetically
    by determining an optimal Galerkin system, we present evidence that
    the {K-L} decomposition systematically destroys dissipation and leads
    to blow up solutions.}

  variation. Using a technique by which Taylor–Green–Kubo formulae are

  abstract = {We present a derivation, a physical explanation and applications of
    cycle expansions in different dynamical systems, ranging from simple
    one-dimensional maps to turbulence in fluids. Cycle expansion is
    a newly devised powerful tool for computing averages of physical
    observables in nonlinear chaotic systems which combines many innovative
    ideas developed in dynamical systems, such as hyperbolicity, invariant
    manifolds, symbolic dynamics, measure theory and thermodynamic formalism.
    The concept of cycle expansion has a deep root in theoretical physics,
    bearing a close analogy to cumulant expansion in statistical physics
    and effective action functional in quantum field theory, the essence
    of which is to represent a physical system in a hierarchical way
    by utilizing certain multiplicative structures such that the dominant
    parts of physical observables are captured by compact, maneuverable
    objects while minor detailed variations are described by objects
    with a larger space and time scale. The technique has been successfully
    applied to many low-dimensional dynamical systems and much effort
    has recently been made to extend its use to spatially extended systems.
    For one-dimensional systems such as the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation,
    the method turns out to be very effective while for more complex
    real-world systems including the Navier-Stokes equation, the method
    is only starting to yield its first fruits and much more work is
    needed to enable practical computations. However, the experience
    and knowledge accumulated so far is already very useful to a large
    set of research problems. Several such applications are briefly described
    in what follows. As more research effort is devoted to the study
    of complex dynamics of nonlinear systems, cycle expansion will undergo
    a fast development and find wide applications.},

  journal = {Tellus A},
  year = {2000},
  volume = {52},
  pages = {523--532},
  abstract = {This paper addresses some fundamental methodological issues concerning
    the sensitivity analysis of chaotic geophysical systems. We show,
    using the Lorenz system as an example, that a naive approach to variational
    (``adjoint'') sensitivity analysis is of limited utility. Applied
    to trajectories which are long relative to the predictability time
    scales of the system, cumulative error growth means that adjoint
    results diverge exponentially from the ``macroscopic climate sensitivity''(that
    is, the sensitivity of time-averaged properties of the system to
    finite-amplitude perturbations). This problem occurs even for time-averaged
    quantities and given infinite computing resources. Alternatively,
    applied to very short trajectories, the adjoint provides an incorrect
    estimate of the sensitivity, even if averaged over large numbers
    of initial conditions, because a finite time scale is required for
    the model climate to respond fully to certain perturbations. In the
    Lorenz (1963) system, an intermediate time scale is found on which
    an ensemble of adjoint gradients can give a reasonably accurate (O(10%))
    estimate of the macroscopic climate sensitivity. While this ensemble-adjoint
    approach is unlikely to be reliable for more complex systems, it
    may provide useful guidance in identifying important parameter-combinations
    to be explored further through direct finite-amplitude perturbations.},

    The method is exposed in the context of discrete-time dynamical systems
    producing a graphical representation of the phase space in terms
    of the invariant set structure that gives a substantial insight into
    the global and local properties of the dynamics. We use the Chirikov
    standard map in order to show the implementation of the method, followed
    by applications to other multi-dimensional maps. We examine the visualization

  abstract = {High-power lasers that fit into a university-scale laboratory can
    now reach focused intensities of more than 1019 W cm-2 at high repetition
    rates. Such lasers are capable of producing beams of energetic electrons,
    protons and -rays. Relativistic electrons are generated through the
    breaking of large-amplitude relativistic plasma waves created in
    the wake of the laser pulse as it propagates through a plasma, or
    through a direct interaction between the laser field and the electrons
    in the plasma. However, the electron beams produced from previous
    laser?plasma experiments have a large energy spread, limiting their
    use for potential applications. Here we report high-resolution energy
    measurements of the electron beams produced from intense laser?plasma
    interactions, showing that?under particular plasma conditions?it
    is possible to generate beams of relativistic electrons with low
    divergence and a small energy spread (less than three per cent).
    The monoenergetic features were observed in the electron energy spectrum
    for plasma densities just above a threshold required for breaking
    of the plasma wave. These features were observed consistently in
    the electron spectrum, although the energy of the beam was observed
    to vary from shot to shot. If the issue of energy reproducibility
    can be addressed, it should be possible to generate ultrashort monoenergetic
    electron bunches of tunable energy, holding great promise for the
    future development of 'table-top' particle accelerators.},

provide low-dimensional visualizations of the dynamics and identify

  abstract = {The purpose of this paper is to develop analytical methods for studyingparticle
    paths in a class of three-dimensional incompressible fluid flows.
    In this paper we study three-dimensionalvolume preserving vector
    fields that are invariant under the action of a one-parameter symmetry
    group whose infinitesimal generator is autonomous and volume-preserving.
    We show that there exists a coordinate system in which the vector
    field assumes a simple form. In particular, the evolution of two
    of the coordinates is governed by a time-dependent, one-degree-of-freedom
    Hamiltonian system with the evolution of the remaining coordinate
    being governed by a first-order differential equation that depends
    only on the other two coordinates and time. The new coordinates depend
    only on the symmetry group of the vector field. Therefore they arefield-independent.
    The coordinate transformation is constructive. If the vector field
    is time-independent, then it possesses an integral of motion. Moreover,
    we show that the system can be further reduced toaction-angle-angle
    coordinates. These are analogous to the familiar action-angle variables
    from Hamiltonian mechanics and are quite useful for perturbative
    studies of the class of systems we consider. In fact, we show how
    our coordinate transformation puts us in a position to apply recent
    extensions of the {Kolmogorov-Arnold-Moser} {(KAM)} theorem for three-dimensional,
    volume-preserving maps as well as three-dimensional versions of Melnikov's
    method. We discuss the integrability of the class of flows considered,
    and draw an analogy with Clebsch variables in fluid mechanics.}

    Hair cells are cells in the inner ear responsible for translating

    then be recorded by the auditory nerve. In nonmammals, two separate
    mechanisms have been postulated to contribute to the amplification
    and tuning properties of the hair cells. Models of each of these
    mechanisms have been shown to be poised near a Hopf bifurcation.
    Through a weakly nonlinear analysis that assumes weak periodic forcing,
    weak damping, and weak coupling, the physiologically based models
    of the two mechanisms are reduced to a system of two coupled amplitude
    equations describing the resonant response. The predictions that
    follow from an analysis of the reduced equations, as well as performance
    benefits due to the coupling of the two mechanisms, are discussed
    and compared with published experimental auditory nerve data.},

abstract={We report on the tendency of chaotic systems to be controlled
onto their unstable periodic orbits in such a way that these orbits are
stabilized. The resulting orbits are known as cupolets and collectively
provide a rich source of qualitative information on the associated
chaotic dynamical system. We show that pairs of interacting cupolets may
be induced into a state of mutually sustained stabilization that requires
no external intervention in order to be maintained and is thus considered
bound or entangled. A number of properties of this sort of entanglement
are discussed. For instance, should the interaction be disturbed, then
the chaotic entanglement would be broken. Based on certain properties of
chaotic systems and on examples which we present, there is further
potential for chaotic entanglement to be naturally occurring. A
discussion of this and of the implications of chaotic entanglement in
future research investigations is also presented.},

approximation of the solution manifolds of parameterized nonlinear
evolution problems, in particular in hyperbolic regimes with moving
discontinuities. Given the action of a Lie group on the solution space,
the original problem is reformulated as a partial differential algebraic
equation system by decomposing the solution into a group component and a
spatial shape component, imposing appropriate algebraic constraints on
the decomposition. The system is then projected onto a reduced basis
space. We show that efficient online evaluation of the scheme is possible
and study a numerical example showing its strongly improved performance
in comparison to a scheme without freezing. "

    Yet all studies of relativistic transparency so far have been restricted

    limiting our understanding of the dynamics of this process. Here
    we present time-resolved electric field measurements (with a temporal

    from, and subsequently transmitted through, an expanding overdense
    plasma. Our result provides insight into the dynamics of the transparent-overdense
    regime of relativistic plasmas, which should be useful in the development
    of laser-driven particle accelerators, X-ray sources and techniques
    for controlling the shape and contrast of intense laser pulses.},

    direction of maximal growth in tangent space. The LV corresponding
    to the second largest Lyapunov exponent generally points in a different
    direction, but tangencies between both vectors can in principle occur.
    Here we find that the probability density function (PDF) of the angle
    ... spanned by the first and second LVs should be expected to be
    approximately symmetric around p/4 and to peak at 0 and p/2. Moreover,
    for small angles we uncover a scaling law for the PDF Q of ? l =
    ln?? with the system size L : Q (? l ) = L -1/2 f (? l L -1/2 ).
    We give a theoretical argument that justifies this scaling form and
    also explains why it should be universal (irrespective of the system
    details) for spatio-temporal chaos in one spatial dimension. This
    article is part of a special issue of Journal of Physics A: Mathematical

    of locally stable and unstable manifolds (the Lyapunov vectors),
    thereby revealing an analogy with generalized synchronization. The
    method is then applied to a periodically forced chaotic oscillator
    to show that the modulus of the Lyapunov exponent associated to the
    phase dynamics increases quadratically with the coupling strength
    and it is therefore different from zero already below the onset of
    phase-synchronization. The analytical calculations are carried out
    for a model, the generalized special flow, that we construct as a
    simplified version of the periodically forced Rossler oscillator.}

    some of the main results without any claims of being exhaustive.
    The fundamental problem in the study of zeta functions is to understand
    the analytic domain of such functions or more generally the meromorphic
    domain. In many interesting cases, these domains extend far beyond
    the initial domain of convergence of the series. The chapter discusses
    dynamical variant on the study of the Lefschetz zeta function. This
    serves to illustrate an important theme in the study of dynamical
    zeta functions, namely that local data (e.g., periodic orbits) can
    have a bearing on the global properties of the transformation f.
    In particular, this involves the idea of characterizing closed orbits
    as either twisted or untwisted. The Lefschetz zeta function then
    reflects the balance between these two types of orbits.},

    matrix elements of the propagator in coherent states, together with
    the linearization of the flux in the neighborhood of a classically
    unstable periodic orbit of chaotic two-dimensional systems. The expression
    derived here is successfully verified to be exact for a (linear)
    cat map, after the theory is adapted to a discrete phase space appropriate
    to a quantized torus.},

  abstract={The classical theory of linear response applies to
  statistical mechanics close to equilibrium. Away from equilibrium, one
  may describe the microscopic time evolution by a general differentiable
  dynamical system, identify nonequilibrium steady states (NESS) and
  study how these vary under perturbations of the dynamics. Remarkably,
  it turns out that for uniformly hyperbolic dynamical systems (those
  satisfying the 'chaotic hypothesis'), the linear response away from
  equilibrium is very similar to the linear response close to
  equilibrium: the Kramers–Kronig dispersion relations hold, and the
  fluctuation–dispersion theorem survives in a modified form (which takes
  into account the oscillations around the 'attractor' corresponding to
  the NESS). If the chaotic hypothesis does not hold, two new phenomena
  may arise. The first is a violation of linear response in the sense
  that the NESS does not depend differentiably on parameters (but this
  nondifferentiability may be hard to see experimentally). The second
  phenomenon is a violation of the dispersion relations: the
  susceptibility has singularities in the upper half complex plane. These
  'acausal' singularities are actually due to 'energy nonconservation':
  for a small periodic perturbation of the system, the amplitude of the
  linear response is arbitrarily large. This means that the NESS of the
  dynamical system under study is not 'inert' but can give energy to the
  outside world. An 'active' NESS of this sort is very different from an
  equilibrium state, and it would be interesting to see what happens for
  active states to the Gallavotti–Cohen fluctuation theorem.}

    to (i) grey or dark character, (ii) the number of humps of the vector
    potential envelope and (iii) their symmetries. The solutions come
    in continuous families in the parametric V?? plane and extend up
    to velocities that approach the speed of light. The stability of
    certain types of grey solitary waves is investigated with the aid
    of particle-in-cell simulations that demonstrate their propagation
    for a few tens of the inverse of the plasma frequency.},

    a constant temperature difference. These equations are then transformed
    to a set of ordinary differential equations governing the time variations
    of the {double-Fourier} coefficients for the motion and temperature
    fields. Non-linear transfer processes are retained and appear as
    quadratic interactions between the Fourier coefficients. Energy and
    heat transfer relations appropriate to this Fourier resolution, and
    a numerical method for solution from arbitrary initial conditions
    are given. As examples of the method, numerical solutions for a highly
    truncated Fourier representation are presented. These solutions,
    which are for a fixed Prandtl number and variable Rayleigh numbers,
    show the transient growth of convection from small perturbations,
    and in all cases studied approach steady states. The steady states
    obtained agree favorably with steady-state solutions obtained by
    previous investigators.}

method (Sanchez et al. (2010)) [11], showing that important savings in
wall-clock time can be achieved. In order to test it, a thermal
convection problem of a binary mixture of fluids has been used. The new
method can also be applied to problems with very low rotation numbers,
for which the previous is not suitable. This is tested in two examples of
two-dimensional maps."

    introduced by Crawford and Hislop Ann. Phys. ({NY)} 189 265 (1989)
    to selectively damp the continuum of neutral modes associated with
    the advection term, thus accelerating convergence. We validate and
    benchmark the performance of our method by reproducing the kinetic
    dispersion relation results for linear (spatially homogeneous) equilibria.
    Finally, we study the stability of a periodic Bernstein-Greene-Kruskal
    mode with multiple phase-space vortices, compare our results with
    numerical simulations of the Vlasov-Poisson system, and show that

    interaction of relativistically intense laser pulses with overcritical

    case of circular polarization. A comparison of particle-in-cell simulations
    to the predictions of a relativistic cold-fluid model for the transparency

    can lead to a substantial increase of the effective critical density
    compared to cold-fluid theory. These results are interpreted by a
    study of separatrices in the single-electron phase space corresponding
    to dynamics in the stationary fields predicted by the cold-fluid
    model. It is shown that perturbations due to electron heating exceeding
    a certain finite threshold can force electrons to escape into the
    vacuum, leading to laser pulse propagation. The modification of the
    transparency threshold is linked to the temporal pulse profile, through
    its effect on electron heating.},

In particular, we stress the importance of accounting for both the nonlinear frequency shift of the electron plasma wave and the growth of sidebands, in order to understand what stops the coherent growth of Raman scattering. Using a Bernstein-Greene-Kruskal approach, we provide an estimate for the maximum amplitude reached by a {BSRS-driven} plasma wave after the phase of monotonic growth. This estimate is in very good agreement with the results from kinetic simulations of stimulated Raman scattering using both a Vlasov and a Particle in Cell code. Our analysis, which may be generalized to a multidimensional geometry, should provide a means to estimate the limits of backward Raman amplification or the effectiveness of strategies that aim at strongly reducing Raman reflectivity in a fusion plasma.},

    perception, extracting from its high-dimensional sensory inputs -30,000
    auditory nerve fibers or 106 optic nerve fibers- manageably small

    local metric information to learn the underlying global geometry
    of a data set. Unlike classical techniques such as principal component
    analysis (PCA) and multidimensional scaling (MDS), our approach is
    capable of discovering the nonlinear degrees of freedom that underlie
    complex natural observations, such as human handwriting or images
    of a face under different viewing conditions. In contrast to previous

    computes a globally optimal solution, and, for an important class
    of data manifolds, is guaranteed to converge asymptotically to the

  abstract = {Constraints are found on the spatial variation of finite-time Lyapunov
    exponents of two and three-dimensional systems of ordinary differential
    equations. In a chaotic system, finite-time Lyapunov exponents describe
    the average rate of separation, along characteristic directions,
    of neighboring trajectories. The solution of the equations is a coordinate
    transformation that takes initial conditions (the Lagrangian coordinates)
    to the state of the system at a later time (the Eulerian coordinates).
    This coordinate transformation naturally defines a metric tensor,
    from which the Lyapunov exponents and characteristic directions are
    obtained. By requiring that the Riemann curvature tensor vanish for
    the metric tensor (a basic result of differential geometry in a flat
    space), differential constraints relating the finite-time Lyapunov
    exponents to the characteristic directions are derived. These constraints
    are realized with exponential accuracy in time. A consequence of
    the relations is that the finite-time Lyapunov exponents are locally
    small in regions where the curvature of the stable manifold is large,
    which has implications for the efficiency of chaotic mixing in the
    advection-diffusion equation. The constraints also modify previous
    estimates of the asymptotic growth rates of quantities in the dynamo
    problem, such as the magnitude of the induced current.}

    We give a description of the second-order response to perturbations
    in terms of Lagrangian derivatives of the exponents and characteristic
    directions. These derivatives are related to generalised Lyapunov
    exponents, which describe deformations of phase space elements beyond
    ellipsoidal. When the flow is chaotic, care must be taken in evaluating
    the derivatives because of the exponential discrepancy in scale along
    the different characteristic directions. Two matrix decomposition
    methods are used to isolate the directions of stretching, the first
    appropriate in finding the asymptotic behaviour of the derivatives
    analytically, the second better suited to numerical evaluation. The
    derivatives are shown to satisfy differential constraints that are
    realised with exponential accuracy in time. With a suitable reinterpretation,
    the results of the paper are shown to apply to the Eulerian framework

    advantage of the knowledge of the system's dynamical instabilities
    in order to improve the quality of the analysis. We present an algorithm,
    four-dimensional variational assimilation in the unstable subspace
    (4DVar-AUS), that consists in confining in this subspace the increment
    of the control variable. The existence of an optimal subspace dimension
    for this confinement is hypothesized. Theoretical arguments in favor
    of the present approach are supported by numerical experiments in
    a simple perfect non-linear model scenario. It is found that the
    RMS analysis error is a function of the dimension N of the subspace
    where the analysis is confined and is minimum for N approximately
    equal to the dimension of the unstable and neutral manifold. For
    all assimilation windows, from 1 to 5 days, 4DVar-AUS performs better
    than standard 4DVar. In the presence of observational noise, the
    4DVar solution, while being closer to the observations, if farther
    away from the truth. The implementation of 4DVar-AUS does not require
    the adjoint integration. }

    A set of vectors are found that satisfy the Oseledec (1968) theorem

    orbit. These vectors, called Lyapunov vectors, can be considered
    the generalization to aperiodic orbits of the normal modes of the
    instability problem and are not necessarily mutually orthogonal.
    The relation between singular vectors and Lyapunov vectors is clarified.
    The mechanism responsible for super-Lyapunov growth is shown to be
    related to the nonorthogonality of Lyapunov vectors. The leading
    Lyapunov vectors, as defined here, as well as the asymptotic final
    singular vectors, are tangent to the attractor, while the leading
    initial singular vectors, in general, point away from it. Perturbations
    that are on the attractor can be found in the subspace of the leading

    to a metastable state whose spanwise wavelength is halved and then
    to complicated time-dependent behavior. These features are in agreement

    present a particular challenge for the application of semiclassical

    of periodic orbit quantization by harmonic inversion of trace formulae,
    which does not rely on the existence of a complete symbolic dynamics
    or other specific properties, lends itself ideally to calculating
    semiclassical eigenvalues from periodic orbit data even in strongly
    pruned systems. We apply the harmonic inversion technique to cross-correlated
    periodic orbit sums, which allows us to reduce the required number
    of orbits. The power, and the limitations, of the method in its present
    form are demonstrated for the closed three-disk billiard as a prime
    example of a classically chaotic bound system with strong pruning.}

    of short-wavelength radiation. Much effort has been devoted to producing
    isolated attosecond pulses, as these are better suited to real-time
    imaging of fundamental electronic processes. Successful methods developed
    so far rely on confining the nonlinear interaction to a single sub-cycle
    event. Here, we demonstrate for the first time a simpler and more
    universal approach to this problem, applied to nonlinear laser?plasma
    interactions. By rotating the instantaneous wavefront direction of
    an intense few-cycle laser field as it interacts with a solid-density
    plasma, we separate the nonlinearly generated attosecond pulse train
    into multiple beams of isolated attosecond pulses propagating in
    different and controlled directions away from the plasma surface.
    This unique method produces a manifold of isolated attosecond pulses,
    ideally synchronized for initiating and probing ultrafast electron
    motion in matter.},

  abstract = {A method for determining the dimension and state space geometry of
    inertial manifolds of dissipative extended dynamical systems is presented.
    It works by projecting vector differences between reference states
    and recurrent states onto local linear subspaces spanned by the Lyapunov
    vectors. A sharp characteristic transition of the projection error
    occurs as soon as the number of basis vectors is increased beyond
    the inertial manifold dimension. Since the method can be applied
    using standard orthogonal Lyapunov vectors, it provides a possible
    way to also determine experimentally inertial manifolds and their
    geometric characteristics.}

  abstract = {Two sets of vectors, covariant Lyapunov vectors (CLVs) and orthogonal
    Lyapunov vectors (OLVs), are currently used to characterize the linear
    stability of chaotic systems. A comparison is made to show their
    similarity and difference, especially with respect to the influence
    on hydrodynamic Lyapunov modes (HLMs). Our numerical simulations
    show that in both Hamiltonian and dissipative systems HLMs formerly
    detected via OLVs survive if CLVs are used instead. Moreover, the
    previous classification of two universality classes works for CLVs
    as well, i.e., the dispersion relation is linear for Hamiltonian
    systems and quadratic for dissipative systems, respectively. The
    significance of HLMs changes in different ways for Hamiltonian and
    dissipative systems with the replacement of OLVs with CLVs. For general
    dissipative systems with nonhyperbolic dynamics the long-wavelength
    structure in Lyapunov vectors corresponding to near-zero Lyapunov
    exponents is strongly reduced if CLVs are used instead, whereas for
    highly hyperbolic dissipative systems the significance of HLMs is
    nearly identical for CLVs and OLVs. In contrast the HLM significance
    of Hamiltonian systems is always comparable for CLVs and OLVs irrespective
    of hyperbolicity. We also find that in Hamiltonian systems different
    symmetry relations between conjugate pairs are observed for CLVs
    and OLVs. Especially, CLVs in a conjugate pair are statistically
    indistinguishable in consequence of the microreversibility of Hamiltonian
    systems. Transformation properties of Lyapunov exponents, CLVs, and
    hyperbolicity under changes of coordinate are discussed in appendices.},

    global bifurcations in two specific physical examples, a laser with
    an injected signal, and a catalytic reaction on a platinum surface.
    Characteristic of these bifurcations is the presence of a highly
    degenerate .... One of the main motivations to study these equations
    is that some of them display spatiotemporal chaos, which in many
    ways, resembles turbulence in fluid dynamics. Recently, different
    efforts to uncover the dynamical origin for these complex states
    have been developing (Goren et al. 1995; Christiansen et al. 1997).}
