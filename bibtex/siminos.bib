scale separation of different subsets of variables and the inclusion of
random processes. The existing algorithms of linear response to external
forcing are vulnerable to the time scale separation due to increased
response errors at fast scales. Here we develop the approximate linear
response algorithm for slow variables in a two-scale dynamical system
with explicit separation of slow and fast variables, which has improved
numerical stability and reduced computational expense. },

    family of normally hyperbolic relative equilibria can change character
    at what we call a `drift bifurcation'. To do this, we use results
    of Arnold to analyse parametrized families of elements in the Lie
    algebra of the symmetry group. We examine effects in physical space
    of such drift bifurcations for planar reaction-diffusion systems
    and note that these effects can explain certain aspects of the transition
    from rigidly rotating spirals to rigidly propagating `retracting
    waves'. This is a bifurcation observed in numerical simulations of
    excitable media where the rotation rate of a family of spirals slows
    down and gives way to a semi-infinite translating wavefront.}

  Abstract                 = {A rigorous proof is given in the standard map for the existence of
    chaotic trajectories with unbounded momenta for large enough coupling
    constant k. The obtained chaotic trajectories correspond to stationary
    configurations of the Frenkel-Kontorowa model with a finite (non-zero)
    photon gap (called gap parameter in dimensionless units). This property
    implies that the trajectory (or the configuration {ui}) can be uniquely
    continued as a uniformly continuous function of the model parameter
    k in some neighborhood of the initial configuration. A non-zero gap
    parameter implies that the Lyapunov coefficient is strictly positive
    (when it is defined). In addition, the existence of dilating and
    contracting manifolds is proven for these chaotic trajectories. ``Exotic''?
    trajectories such as ballistic trajectories are also proven to exist
    as a consequence of these theorems. The concept of anti-integrability
    emerges from these theorems. In the anti-integrable limit which can
    be only defined for a discrete time dynamical system, the coordinates
    of the trajectory at time i do not depend on the coordinates at time
    i - 1. Thus, at this singular limit, the existence of chaotic trajectories
    is trivial and the dynamical system reduces to a Bernoulli shift.
    It appears that the chaotic trajectories of dynamical systems originate
    by continuity from those which exists at the anti-integrable limits.},

    gives a theoretical explanation of the superior convergence of the
    cycle expansion of the Lyapunov exponent (Bai 2007 J. Phys. A: Math.

    matrix is applied to a one-dimensional Ising model with a random

symmetric periodic orbits in Hamiltonian systems of two degrees of
freedom. The method is based on the classical search method but combining
up-to-date numerical algorithms in the search and in the integration
process. Instead of using Newton methods that requires to differentiate
the Poincar\' map we use the Brent?s method and in the integration process
a Taylor series method that permits us to compute the orbits using
extended precision, something highly interesting in the case of unstable
periodic orbits. These facts have permitted us to obtain many more
periodic orbits than other researchers. Once the families of periodic
orbits have been found we study the bifurcations just by comparing with
the stability index and the classical generic bifurcations for
Hamiltonian systems with and without symmetries. We illustrate the method
with four important classical Hamiltonian problems. },

provide rigorous skeletons of periodic orbits. To that goal we show how
to prove the existence and stability of a huge set of discrete initial
conditions of periodic orbits, and later, how to prove the existence and
stability of continuous families of periodic orbits. We illustrate the
approach with two paradigmatic problems: the H{\'{e}}non-Heiles Hamiltonian and
the Diamagnetic Kepler problem. },

  Abstract                 = {The crossing of the narrow skin layer in solid targets by electrons
    in a time shorter than a laser cycle represents one of the numerous
    collisionless absorption mechanisms of intense laser-matter interaction.
    This kinetic effect is studied at normal and oblique laser beam incidence
    and particle injection by a test particle approach in an energy interval
    extending into the relativistic domain. Three main results obtained
    are the strong dependence of the energy gain by the single particle
    on the instant of injection relative to the phase of the light wave,
    the reflection of the particles primarily contributing to absorption
    well in front of the target rather than in the Debye layer, and the
    low degree of absorption hardly exceeding the 10\% limit. The simulation
    results offer a more unambiguous interpretation of the absorption
    mechanism often referred to as ?vacuum heating.? In particular, it
    is clearly revealed that the absorption in the vacuum region prevails
    on that originating from the skin layer. Relativistic ponderomotive
    effects are also tested, however their contribution to absorption
    is not significant.},

  Abstract                 = {The classical field theories that underlie the quantum
treatments of the electromagnetic, weak, and strong forces share a
peculiar feature: specifying the initial state of the field determines
the evolution of some degrees of freedom of the theory while leaving the
evolution of some others wholly arbitrary. This strongly suggests that
some of the variables of the standard state space lack physical
content?intuitively, the space of states of such a theory is of higher
dimension than the corresponding space of genuine physical possibilities.
The structure of such theories can helpfully be characterized in terms of
the action of symmetry groups on their space of states; and the
conceptual problems surrounding their strange behavior can be sharpened
in light of the observation that it is usually possible to eliminate the
redundant variables associated with these symmetries?which turn out to be
precisely those variables whose evolution is unconstrained by the
dynamical laws of the theory. This paper discusses this approach, uses it
to frame questions about the interpretation of classical gauge theories,
and to reflect (pessimistically) on our prospects of reaching
satisfactory answers to these questions. },

(and the corresponding eigenvectors) of a nonlinear holomorphic
eigenvalue problem that lie within a given contour in the complex plane.
No initial approximations of eigenvalues and eigenvectors are needed. The
method is particularly suitable for moderately large eigenvalue problems
where k is much smaller than the matrix dimension.},

  Abstract                 = {On connections between symmetries and conservation laws. After reviewing
    Noether's theorem and its limitations, we present the Direct Construction
    Method to show how to find directly the conservation laws for any
    given system of differential equations. This method yields the multipliers
    for conservation laws as well as an integral formula for corresponding
    conserved densities. The action of a symmetry (discrete or continuous)
    on a conservation law yields conservation laws. Conservation laws
    yield non-locally related systems that, in turn, can yield nonlocal
    symmetries and in addition be useful for the application of other
    mathematical methods. From symmetries or multipliers for conservation
    laws, one can determine whether or not a given system of differential
    equations can be linearized by an invertible transformation.}

    Here, we demonstrate attosecond control of collective electron motion
    in plasmas driven by extreme intensity (?1018 W cm?2) light fields.
    Controlled few-cycle near-infrared waves are tightly focused at the
    interface between vacuum and a solid-density plasma, where they launch
    and guide subcycle motion of electrons from the plasma with characteristic
    energies in the multi-kiloelectronvolt range?two orders of magnitude
    more than has been achieved so far in atoms and molecules. The basic
    spectroscopy of the coherent extreme ultraviolet radiation emerging
    from the light?plasma interaction allows us to probe this collective
    motion of charge with sub-200 as resolution. This is an important
    step towards attosecond control of charge dynamics in laser-driven
    plasma experiments.},

  Abstract                 = {A fundamental class of solutions of symmetric Hamiltonian systems
    is relative equilibria. In this paper the nonlinear problem near
    a degenerate relative equilibrium is considered. The degeneracy creates
    a saddle-center and attendant homoclinic bifurcation in the reduced
    system transverse to the group orbit. The surprising result is that
    the curvature of the pullback of the momentum map to the Lie algebra
    determines the normal form for the homoclinic bifurcation. There
    is also an induced directional geometric phase in the homoclinic
    bifurcation. The backbone of the analysis is the use of singularity
    theory for smooth mappings between manifolds applied to the pullback
    of the momentum map. The theory is constructive and generalities
    are given for symmetric Hamiltonian systems on a vector space of
    dimension (2n+2) with an n-dimensional abelian symmetry group. Examples
    for n=1,2,3 are presented to illustrate application of the theory.}

  Abstract                 = {The method we present in this paper uses trajectory averages of scalar
    functions on the state space to: (a) identify invariant sets in the
    state space, and (b) to form coherent structures by aggregating invariant
    sets that are similar across multiple spatial scales. First, we construct
    the ergodic quotient, the object obtained by mapping trajectories
    to the space of the trajectory averages of a function basis on the
    state space. Second, we endow the ergodic quotient with a metric
    structure that successfully captures how similar the invariant sets
    are in the state space. Finally, we parametrize the ergodic quotient
    using intrinsic diffusion modes on it. By segmenting the ergodic
    quotient based on the diffusion modes, we extract coherent features
    in the state space of the dynamical system. The algorithm is validated
    by analyzing the Arnold-Beltrami-Childress flow, which was the test-bed
    for alternative approaches: the Ulam's approximation of the transfer
    operator and the computation of Lagrangian Coherent Structures. Furthermore,
    we explain how the method extends the Poincar\'e map analysis for
    periodic flows. As a demonstration, we apply the method to a periodically-driven
    three-dimensional Hill's vortex flow, discovering unknown coherent
    structures in its state space.},

    by the derivative nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation, in the low-dimensional
    limit described by stationary spatial solutions, is studied. A bifurcation
    diagram is constructed, by varying the driver amplitude, to identify
    a number of nonlinear dynamical processes including saddle-node bifurcation,
    boundary crisis, and interior crisis. The roles played by unstable
    periodic orbits and chaotic saddles in these transitions are analyzed,
    and the conversion from a chaotic saddle to a chaotic attractor in
    these dynamical processes is demonstrated. In particular, the phenomenon
    of gap-filling in the chaotic transition from weak chaos to strong
    chaos via an interior crisis is investigated. A coupling unstable
    periodic orbit created by an explosion, within the gaps of the chaotic
    saddles embedded in a chaotic attractor following an interior crisis,
    is found numerically. The gap-filling unstable periodic orbits are
    responsible for coupling the banded chaotic saddle (BCS) to the surrounding
    chaotic saddle (SCS), leading to crisis-induced intermittency. The

    the dynamical system with an orthonormal k-dimensional frame and
    a Lyapunov vector such that the frame is continuously Gram-Schmidt
    orthonormalized and at most linear growth of the dynamical variables
    is involved. We prove that the method is strongly stable when where
    is the kth Lyapunov exponent in descending order and we show through

    a non-smooth dependence of global observables on parameters changes.
    A paradigmatic example is the fractal diffusion coefficient arising
    in a simple piecewise linear one-dimensional map of the real line.
    Using the Baladi-Ruelle generalization of the Milnor-Thurnston kneading

  theoretical framework that greatly simplifies analytical and numerical
  investigations of the escape rate in open systems. As an example, we
  explicitly derive the exact size- and position-dependent escape rate in
  a Markov case for holes of finite-size . Moreover, a general relation
  between the transfer operators of the closed and corresponding open
  systems, together with the generating function of the probability of
  return to the hole is derived. This relation is then used to compute
  the small hole asymptotic behavior, in terms of readily calculable
  quantities. As an example we derive logarithmic corrections in the
  second order term. Being valid for Markov systems, our framework can
  find application in many areas of the physical sciences such as
  information theory, network theory, quantum Weyl law and, via Ulam{\textquoteright}s
  method, can be used as an approximation method in general dynamical
  systems.},

    rotating and regular {Rayleigh-B\'{e}nard} convection. The enormous number
    of available degrees of freedom is a vivid feature. A set of interesting
    questions have been raised, including how to characterize a spatiotemporal
    chaotic state. The importance of the study of small subsystems is
    emphasized.}

    we address the problems of applying this formalism to bound chaotic
    systems, caused by e.g. intermittency and non-completeness of the
    symbolic dynamics. For bound intermittent systems we derive an approximation
    of the zeta function. With the aid of this zeta function it is argued
    that bound systems with long time tails have branch cuts in the zeta
    function and traces (of the evolution operator) approaching unity
    as a power law. We also show that the dominant time scale can be
    much longer than the period of the shortest periodic orbit, as is,
    for example, the case for the hyperbola billiard. Isolated zeros
    of the zeta function for the hyperbola billiard are evaluated by
    means of a cycle expansion. Crucial for the success of this approach
    is the identification of a sequence of periodic orbit responsible
    for a logarithmic branch cut in the zeta function. Semiclassical
    implications are briefly discussed.},

    is utilized so that the zeta functions may be approximately expressed
    in terms of the probability distribution of laminar lengths. In particular
    we study a one-parameter family of weights. Depending on the parameter
    the trace can be dominated by branch cuts in the zeta function or
    by isolated zeros. In the former case the time dependence of the
    trace is dominated by a power law and in the latter case by an exponential.
    A phase transition occurs when the leading zero collides with a branch
    cut. The family considered is relevant for the calculation of resonance
    spectra, semiclassical spectra and topological entropy.},

    stable heteroclinic connections that arise for these parameter values.
    We reanalyze the ones that were previously described via a {4D} reduction
    to the center-unstable manifold {(Ambruster} et al., 1988, 1989).
    We also find a parameter region for which a manifold of structurally
    stable heteroclinic cycles exist. The existence of such a manifold
    is responsible for an intermittent behavior which has some features
    of unpredictability.}

    The computations include detection of bifurcations and corresponding
    branch switching. A simple example is used to illustrate the main
    idea. Thereafter we compute families of periodic solutions of the
    circular restricted 3-body problem. We also continue the figure-8
    orbit recently discovered by Chenciner and Montgomery, and numerically
    computed by Simu'o, as the mass of one of the bodies is allowed to
    vary. In particular, we show how the invariances (phase-shift, scaling
    law, and x, y, z translations and rotations) can be dealt with. Our
    numerical results show, among other things, that there exists a continuous
    path of periodic solutions from the figure-8 orbit to a periodic
    solution of the restricted 3-body problem.}

  Abstract                 = {Extreme ultraviolet ({XUV)} and X-ray harmonic spectra produced by
    intense laser?solid interactions have, so far, been consistent with
    Doppler upshifted reflection from collective relativistic plasma
    oscillations?the relativistically oscillating mirror mechanism. Recent
    theoretical work, however, has identified a new interaction regime
    in which dense electron nanobunches are formed at the plasma?vacuum
    boundary resulting in coherent {XUV} radiation by coherent synchrotron
    emission ({CSE).} Our experiments enable the isolation of {CSE} from
    competing processes, demonstrating that electron nanobunch formation
    does indeed occur. We observe spectra with the characteristic spectral
    signature of {CSE?a} slow decay of intensity, I, with high-harmonic
    order, n, as I(n) n?1.62 before a rapid efficiency rollover. Particle-in-cell
    code simulations reveal how dense nanobunches of electrons are periodically
    formed and accelerated during normal-incidence interactions with
    ultrathin foils and result in {CSE} in the transmitted direction.
    This observation of {CSE} presents a route to high-energy {XUV} pulses
    and offers a new window on understanding ultrafast energy coupling
    during intense laser?solid density interactions.},

  Abstract                 = {Laser-driven plasma-based accelerators, which are capable of supporting
    fields in excess of 100 {GV}, are reviewed. This includes the laser
    wakefield accelerator, the plasma beat wave accelerator, the self-modulated
    laser wakefield accelerator, plasma waves driven by multiple laser
    pulses, and highly nonlinear regimes. The properties of linear and
    nonlinear plasma waves are discussed, as well as electron acceleration
    in plasma waves. Methods for injecting and trapping plasma electrons
    in plasma waves are also discussed. Limits to the electron energy
    gain are summarized, including laser pulse diffraction, electron
    dephasing, laser pulse energy depletion, and beam loading limitations.
    The basic physics of laser pulse evolution in underdense plasmas
    is also reviewed. This includes the propagation, self-focusing, and
    guiding of laser pulses in uniform plasmas and with preformed density
    channels. Instabilities relevant to intense short-pulse laser-plasma
    interactions, such as Raman, self-modulation, and hose instabilities,
    are discussed. Experiments demonstrating key physics, such as the
    production of high-quality electron bunches at energies of 0.1 {GeV},
    are summarized.},

  Abstract                 = {Prequantum dynamics was introduced in the 70s by
Kostant, Souriau and Kirillov as an intermediate between
classical and quantum dynamics. In common with the classical
dynamics, prequantum dynamics transports functions on phase
space, but adds some phases which are important in quantum
interference effects. In the case of hyperbolic dynamical
systems, it is believed that the study of the prequantum
dynamics will give a better understanding of the quantum
interference effects for large time, and of their statistical
properties. We consider a linear hyperbolic map which generates
a chaotic dynamical system on
the torus. The dynamics is lifted to a prequantum fiber bundle.
This gives a unitary prequantum (partially hyperbolic) map. We
calculate its resonances and show that they are related to the
quantum eigenvalues. A remarkable consequence is that quantum
dynamics emerges from long-term behavior of prequantum
dynamics. We present trace formulas, and discuss perspectives
of this approach in the nonlinear case.},

  Abstract                 = {Particle accelerators are used in a wide variety of fields, ranging
    from medicine and biology to high-energy physics. The accelerating
    fields in conventional accelerators are limited to a few tens of
    {MeV} m-1, owing to material breakdown at the walls of the structure.
    Thus, the production of energetic particle beams currently requires
    large-scale accelerators and expensive infrastructures. Laser?plasma
    accelerators have been proposed as a next generation of compact accelerators
    because of the huge electric fields they can sustain ({\textgreater}100
    {GeV} m-1). However, it has been difficult to use them efficiently
    for applications because they have produced poor-quality particle
    beams with large energy spreads, owing to a randomization of electrons
    in phase space. Here we demonstrate that this randomization can be
    suppressed and that the quality of the electron beams can be dramatically
    enhanced. Within a length of 3 mm, the laser drives a plasma bubble
    that traps and accelerates plasma electrons. The resulting electron
    beam is extremely collimated and quasi-monoenergetic, with a high
    charge of 0.5 {nC} at 170 {MeV.}},

    by extending the theory developed by Field and Richardson {[}37]
    for absolutely irreducible representations of finite groups to general
    irreducible representations of compact Lie groups. In particular,
    we allow for branches of relative equilibria and phenomena such as
    the Hopf bifurcation. We also present a general theory of determinacy
    for irreducible Lie group actions along the lines previously described
    in Field {[}29]. In the main result of this work, we show that branching
    patterns for generic equivariant bifurcation problems defined on
    irreducible representations persist under perturbations by sufficiently
    high order non-equivariant terms. We give applications of this result
    to normal form computations yielding, for example, equivariant Hopf
    bifurcations and show how normal form computations of branching and
    stabilities are valid when we take account of the non-normalized
    tail.}}

  Abstract                 = {In this paper, we investigate the saturation mechanisms of backward stimulated Raman scattering ({BSRS)} induced by nonlinear kinetic effects. In particular, we stress the importance of accounting for both the nonlinear frequency shift of the electron plasma wave and the growth of sidebands, in order to understand what stops the coherent growth of Raman scattering. Using a Bernstein-Greene-Kruskal approach, we provide an estimate for the maximum amplitude reached by a {BSRS-driven} plasma wave after the phase of monotonic growth. This estimate is in very good agreement with the results from kinetic simulations of stimulated Raman scattering using both a Vlasov and a Particle in Cell code. Our analysis, which may be generalized to a multidimensional geometry, should provide a means to estimate the limits of backward Raman amplification or the effectiveness of strategies that aim at strongly reducing Raman reflectivity in a fusion plasma.},

  Abstract                 = {... detecting UPOs of nonlinear map is one of the most challenging
    problems of nonlinear science in both numerical computations and
    experimental measures. In this paper, a new method is proposed to
    detect the UPOs in a non-Lyapunov way. Firstly three special techniques
    are added to quantum-behaved particle swarm optimization (QPSO),
    a novel mbest particle, contracting the searching space self-adaptively
    and boundaries restriction (NCB), then the new method NCB--QPSO is
    proposed. It can maintain an effective search mechanism with fine
    equilibrium between exploitation and exploration. Secondly, the problems
    of detecting the UPOs are converted into a non-negative functions'
    minimization through a proper translation in a non-Lyapunov way.
    Thirdly the simulations to 6 benchmark optimization problems and
    different high order UPOs of 5 classic nonlinear maps are done by
    the proposed method. And the results show that NCB--QPSO is a successful
    method in detecting the UPOs, and it has the advantages of fast convergence,
    high precision and robustness.},

      the Fokker-Planck operator on the basis of the
      Pollicott-Ruelle resonances of the noiseless
      deterministic system, which is assumed to be
      non-bifurcating. At first order in the noise amplitude,
      the effect of noise on a periodic orbit is given in terms
      of the period and the derivative of the period with
      respect to the pseudo-energy of the
      Onsager-Machlup-Freidlin-Wentzell scheme. },

  Abstract                 = {Laser-driven accelerators, in which particles are accelerated by the
    electric field of a plasma wave (the wakefield) driven by an intense
    laser, have demonstrated accelerating electric fields of hundreds
    of {GV} m-1 (refs 1?3). These fields are thousands of times greater
    than those achievable in conventional radio-frequency accelerators,
    spurring interest in laser accelerators as compact next-generation
    sources of energetic electrons and radiation. To date, however, acceleration
    distances have been severely limited by the lack of a controllable
    method for extending the propagation distance of the focused laser
    pulse. The ensuing short acceleration distance results in low-energy
    beams with 100 per cent electron energy spread, which limits potential
    applications. Here we demonstrate a laser accelerator that produces
    electron beams with an energy spread of a few per cent, low emittance
    and increased energy (more than 109 electrons above 80 {MeV).} Our
    technique involves the use of a preformed plasma density channel
    to guide a relativistically intense laser, resulting in a longer
    propagation distance. The results open the way for compact and tunable
    high-brightness sources of electrons and radiation.},

dynamics with local confinement, in which interactions between
neighboring particles occur through hard core elastic
collisions. Such dynamics may be described as high-dimensional
billiards. We consider the case where the collisions are rare
and, for large systems, derive a Boltzmann-like equation for
the evolution of the probability densities. We solve this
equation in the linear regime and compute the heat conductivity
in the approximate stationary state and with the help of the
Green-Kubo formula. We demonstrate the validity of the
molecular chaos hypothesis by comparing our theoretical
predictions to the results of numerical simulations performed
on a new class of models, which are defocusing chaotic
billiards, likened to higher-dimensional stadia.},

    with a finite stirring region undergoing chaotic advection. We study
    the homogenization of dye in two variants of an eggbeater stirring
    protocol that differ in the extent of their mixing region. In the
    first case, the mixing region is separated from the side walls of
    the channel, while in the second it extends to the walls. For the
    first case, we observe the onset of a permanent concentration pattern
    that repeats over time with decaying intensity. A quantitative analysis
    of the concentration field of dye confirms the convergence to a self-similar
    pattern, akin to the strange eigenmodes previously observed in closed
    flows. We model this phenomenon using an idealized map, where an
    analysis of the mixing dynamics explains the convergence to an eigenmode.
    In contrast, for the second case the presence of no-slip walls and
    separation points on the frontier of the mixing region leads to non-self-similar
    mixing dynamics.}

    be used in climate studies. The widely used ones are the Lyapunov
    exponents, the Kolmogorov entropy and the attractor dimension characterizing
    global quantities of a system. Another potentially useful tool from
    dynamical system theory arises from the fact that the local analysis
    of a system probability distribution function (PDF) can be accomplished
    by using a procedure that involves an expansion in terms of unstable
    periodic orbits (UPOs). The system measure (or its statistical characteristics)
    is approximated as a weighted sum over the orbits. The weights are
    inversely proportional to the orbit instability characteristics so
    that the least unstable orbits make larger contributions to the PDF.
    Consequently, one can expect some relationship between the least
    unstable orbits and the local maxima of the system PDF. As a result,
    the most probable system trajectories (or `circulation regimes' in
    some sense) may be explained in terms of orbits. For the special
    classes of chaotic dynamical systems, there is a strict theory guaranteeing
    the accuracy of this approach. However, a typical atmospheric model
    may not qualify for these theorems. In our study, we will try to
    apply the idea of UPO expansion to the simple atmospheric system
    based on the barotropic vorticity equation of the sphere. We will
    check how well orbits approximate the system attractor, its statistical
    characteristics and PDF. The connection of the most probable states
    of the system with the least unstable periodic orbits will also be

  Abstract                 = {Unstable periodic trajectories of a chaotic dissipative system belong
    to the attractor of the system and are its important characteristics.
    Many chaotic systems have an infinite number of periodic solutions
    forming the skeleton of the system attractor. This allows one to
    approximate the system trajectories and statistical characteristics
    by using periodic solutions. The least unstable orbits may generate
    local maxima of the system state distribution functions on the attractor.
    With respect to atmospheric systems this means that orbits may determine
    dynamic circulation regimes and typical variability modes of the
    system. In some cases, given a small number of periodic solutions,
    one can describe the dynamics on the attractor of the system and
    the basic statistics with sufficient precision. Thus, the information
    concerning periodic trajectories of a particular dynamic system may
    be very important for analysis of its behavior. A search for periodic
    trajectories is reduced to the solution of a system of nonlinear
    equations with respect to the initial condition of an orbit and its
    period. The choice of a numerical solution method and an initial
    guess is an important aspect here. In this paper we consider the
    problem of the calculation of periodic trajectories for a barotropic
    model of the atmosphere. Several methods for determination of periodic
    orbits of the model are formulated and implemented, including the
    Newton method with step suppression, the Newton method with a second
    order tensor correction, the quasi-Newton method with step suppression,
    the quasi-Newton method with minimization of the error functional
    and approximate Hessian inversion by the LBFG scheme and the GMRES
    method. A comparison of the efficiency of these numerical methods
    and different choices of initial conditions is performed. Various
    factors influencing the rate of convergence of the methods are considered.},

    methods to construct the pruning front. When the map is hyperbolic,
    the language of symbol sequences is regular in the sense of the Chomsky
    hierarchy and the corresponding grammatical complexity takes finite
    values. It is found that the complexity exhibits a self-similar structure
    as a function of the system parameter, and the similarity of the
    pruning fronts is discussed as an origin of such self-similarity.
    For non-hyperbolic cases, it is observed that the complexity monotonically
    increases as we increase the resolution of the pruning front.}

    structures in two-dimensional turbulence. The boundaries are defined
    as material lines that are linearly stable or unstable for longer
    times than any of their neighbors. Such material lines are responsible
    for stretching and folding in the mixing of passive tracers. We derive
    an analytic criterion that can be used to extract coherent structures
    with high precision from numerical or experimental data sets. The
    criterion provides a rigorous link between the Lagrangian concept
    of hyperbolicity, the {Okubo?Weiss} criterion, and vortex boundaries.
    We apply the results to simulations of two-dimensional barotropic
    turbulence.},

    flows) using the method of covariant Lyapunov analysis developed
    by Ginelli et al. (2007). As the Reynolds number is increased, chaotic
    Kolmogorov flows become non-hyperbolic at a certain Reynolds number,
    where some new physical property is expected to appear in the long-time
    statistics of the fluid motion. Here we focus our attention on behaviors
    of the time-correlation function of vorticity across the transition
    point, and that the long-time asymptotic form of the correlation
    function changes at the Reynolds number close to that of the hyperbolic/non-hyperbolic
    transition, which suggests that the time-correlation function reflects
    the transition to non-hyperbolicity.},

    (e.g. systems with translational invariance associated with traveling
    solutions and scale invariance associated with self-similar solutions)
    in a "co-evolving" frame (i.e. a frame which is co-traveling, co-collapsing
    or co-exploding with the evolving solution) leads to improved accuracy
    because of the smaller time derivative in the new spatial frame.
    The slower time behavior permits the use of projective and coarse
    projective integration with longer projective steps in the computation
    of the time evolution of partial differential equations and multiscale
    systems, respectively. These methods are also demonstrated to be
    effective for systems which only approximately or asymptotically
    possess continuous symmetries. The ideas of projective integration
    in a co-evolving frame are illustrated on the one-dimensional, translationally
    invariant Nagumo partial differential equation {(PDE).} A corresponding
    kinetic Monte Carlo model, motivated from the Nagumo kinetics, is
    used to illustrate the coarse-grained method. A simple, one-dimensional
    diffusion problem is used to illustrate the scale invariant case.
    The efficiency of projective integration in the co-evolving frame
    for both the macroscopic diffusion {PDE} and for a random-walker
    particle based model is again demonstrated.}

    the forcing perturbation which maximizes the norm of the perturbation
    of a statistical moment of the solution on the attractor. The method
    was applied to the Lorenz model. The estimates of perturbations of
    two statistical moments were compared with directly calculated values.
    The comparison shows that some 100 UPOs are sufficient to realize
    this approach and get a good accuracy. The linear approach remains
    valid up to rather high norms of the forcing perturbation.},

    straight pipe remains one of the oldest problems in fluid mechanics.
    So far no explanation has been substantiated to rationalize the transition
    process by which the steady unidirectional laminar flow state gives
    way to a temporally and spatially disordered three-dimensional (turbulent)
    solution as the flow rate increases. Recently, new travelling wave
    solutions have been discovered which are saddle points in phase space.
    These plausibly represent the lowest level in a hierarchy of spatio-temporal
    periodic flow solutions which may be used to construct a cycle expansion
    theory of turbulent pipe flows. We summarize this success against
    the backdrop of past work and discuss its implications for future
    research.}

  coefficient varies across the family of maps and under parameter
  variation. Using a technique by which Taylor--Green--Kubo formulae are
  evaluated in terms of generalized Takagi functions, we derive exact,
  fully analytical expressions for the diffusion coefficients. Typically,
  for simple maps these quantities are fractal functions of control
  parameters. However, our family of four maps exhibits both fractal and
  linear behaviour. We explain these different structures by looking at

  Abstract                 = {By constructing a 2N-dimensional symplectic map for a Langrangian
    system, the orbit structure of the phase space is discussed for a
    time-reversible system. Periodic orbits are classfied according to
    the rotation number, symmetry, and morse index. Unstable orbits repel
    other periodic orbits to form resonances where a orbit can be trapped
    for long with the same rotation number. The chain of resonances with
    the same commensurability forms channel which provides the communication
    bridge between different resonances. The connection of the orbit
    structure with the continued fraction representation of real numbers
    is discussed.}

  Abstract                 = {We present a derivation, a physical explanation and applications of
    cycle expansions in different dynamical systems, ranging from simple
    one-dimensional maps to turbulence in fluids. Cycle expansion is
    a newly devised powerful tool for computing averages of physical
    observables in nonlinear chaotic systems which combines many innovative
    ideas developed in dynamical systems, such as hyperbolicity, invariant
    manifolds, symbolic dynamics, measure theory and thermodynamic formalism.
    The concept of cycle expansion has a deep root in theoretical physics,
    bearing a close analogy to cumulant expansion in statistical physics
    and effective action functional in quantum field theory, the essence
    of which is to represent a physical system in a hierarchical way
    by utilizing certain multiplicative structures such that the dominant
    parts of physical observables are captured by compact, maneuverable
    objects while minor detailed variations are described by objects
    with a larger space and time scale. The technique has been successfully
    applied to many low-dimensional dynamical systems and much effort
    has recently been made to extend its use to spatially extended systems.
    For one-dimensional systems such as the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation,
    the method turns out to be very effective while for more complex
    real-world systems including the Navier-Stokes equation, the method
    is only starting to yield its first fruits and much more work is
    needed to enable practical computations. However, the experience
    and knowledge accumulated so far is already very useful to a large
    set of research problems. Several such applications are briefly described
    in what follows. As more research effort is devoted to the study
    of complex dynamics of nonlinear systems, cycle expansion will undergo
    a fast development and find wide applications.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper addresses some fundamental methodological issues concerning
    the sensitivity analysis of chaotic geophysical systems. We show,
    using the Lorenz system as an example, that a naive approach to variational
    (``adjoint'') sensitivity analysis is of limited utility. Applied
    to trajectories which are long relative to the predictability time
    scales of the system, cumulative error growth means that adjoint
    results diverge exponentially from the ``macroscopic climate sensitivity''(that
    is, the sensitivity of time-averaged properties of the system to
    finite-amplitude perturbations). This problem occurs even for time-averaged
    quantities and given infinite computing resources. Alternatively,
    applied to very short trajectories, the adjoint provides an incorrect
    estimate of the sensitivity, even if averaged over large numbers
    of initial conditions, because a finite time scale is required for
    the model climate to respond fully to certain perturbations. In the
    Lorenz (1963) system, an intermediate time scale is found on which
    an ensemble of adjoint gradients can give a reasonably accurate (O(10%))
    estimate of the macroscopic climate sensitivity. While this ensemble-adjoint
    approach is unlikely to be reliable for more complex systems, it
    may provide useful guidance in identifying important parameter-combinations
    to be explored further through direct finite-amplitude perturbations.},

    the equations of a two-level geostrophic model in truncated double-Fourier
    series. The model includes the nonlinear interactions among disturbances
    of three different wave lengths. Nonperiodic time-dependent solutions
    are determined by numerical integration.By comparing separate solutions
    with slightly different initial conditions, the growth rate of small
    initial errors is studied. The time required for errors comparable
    to observational errors in the atmosphere to grow to intolerable
    errors is strongly dependent upon the current circulation pattern,
    and varies from a few days to a few weeks.Some statistical predictability
    of certain quantities seems to be present even after errors in the
    complete circulation pattern are no longer small. The feasibility
    of performing similar studies with much larger atmospheric models
    is considered.},

  Abstract                 = {Ion acceleration driven by superintense laser pulses is attracting
    an impressive and steadily increasing effort. Motivations can be
    found in the applicative potential and in the perspective to investigate
    novel regimes as available laser intensities will be increasing.
    Experiments have demonstrated, over a wide range of laser and target
    parameters, the generation of multi-{MeV} proton and ion beams with
    unique properties such as ultrashort duration, high brilliance, and
    low emittance. An overview is given of the state of the art of ion
    acceleration by laser pulses as well as an outlook on its future
    development and perspectives. The main features observed in the experiments,
    the observed scaling with laser and plasma parameters, and the main
    models used both to interpret experimental data and to suggest new
    research directions are described.},

higher-order bright solitons in nonlinear nonlocal media have been
frequently observed numerically in recent years, however, the origin of
these phenomena was never completely elucidated. In this paper, we
perform a linear stability analysis of these higher-order solitons by
solving the Bogoliubov-de Gennes equations. This enables us to understand
the emergence of a new oscillatory state as a growing unstable mode of a
higher-order soliton. Using dynamically important states as a basis, we
provide low-dimensional visualizations of the dynamics and identify

  Abstract                 = {The purpose of this paper is to develop analytical methods for studyingparticle
    paths in a class of three-dimensional incompressible fluid flows.
    In this paper we study three-dimensionalvolume preserving vector
    fields that are invariant under the action of a one-parameter symmetry
    group whose infinitesimal generator is autonomous and volume-preserving.
    We show that there exists a coordinate system in which the vector
    field assumes a simple form. In particular, the evolution of two
    of the coordinates is governed by a time-dependent, one-degree-of-freedom
    Hamiltonian system with the evolution of the remaining coordinate
    being governed by a first-order differential equation that depends
    only on the other two coordinates and time. The new coordinates depend
    only on the symmetry group of the vector field. Therefore they arefield-independent.
    The coordinate transformation is constructive. If the vector field
    is time-independent, then it possesses an integral of motion. Moreover,
    we show that the system can be further reduced toaction-angle-angle
    coordinates. These are analogous to the familiar action-angle variables
    from Hamiltonian mechanics and are quite useful for perturbative
    studies of the class of systems we consider. In fact, we show how
    our coordinate transformation puts us in a position to apply recent
    extensions of the {Kolmogorov-Arnold-Moser} {(KAM)} theorem for three-dimensional,
    volume-preserving maps as well as three-dimensional versions of Melnikov's
    method. We discuss the integrability of the class of flows considered,
    and draw an analogy with Clebsch variables in fluid mechanics.}

stabilizers, orbit types and their strata are introduced and illustrated
by simple examples. We give the unified description of these notions
which are often used in the different domains of physics under different
names. We also explain some basic facts about rings of invariant
functions and their module structure. This leads to a geometrical study
of the orbit space and of the level surfaces of invariant functions (e.g.
energy levels of Hamiltonians). Combining these tools with Morse theory
we study the extrema of invariant functions. Some physical applications
(not studied in other chapters) are sketched. },

    Hair cells are cells in the inner ear responsible for translating
    sound-induced mechanical stimuli into an electrical signal that can
    then be recorded by the auditory nerve. In nonmammals, two separate
    mechanisms have been postulated to contribute to the amplification
    and tuning properties of the hair cells. Models of each of these
    mechanisms have been shown to be poised near a Hopf bifurcation.
    Through a weakly nonlinear analysis that assumes weak periodic forcing,
    weak damping, and weak coupling, the physiologically based models
    of the two mechanisms are reduced to a system of two coupled amplitude
    equations describing the resonant response. The predictions that
    follow from an analysis of the reduced equations, as well as performance
    benefits due to the coupling of the two mechanisms, are discussed
    and compared with published experimental auditory nerve data.},

onto their unstable periodic orbits in such a way that these orbits are
stabilized. The resulting orbits are known as cupolets and collectively
provide a rich source of qualitative information on the associated
chaotic dynamical system. We show that pairs of interacting cupolets may
be induced into a state of mutually sustained stabilization that requires
no external intervention in order to be maintained and is thus considered
bound or entangled. A number of properties of this sort of entanglement
are discussed. For instance, should the interaction be disturbed, then
the chaotic entanglement would be broken. Based on certain properties of
chaotic systems and on examples which we present, there is further
potential for chaotic entanglement to be naturally occurring. A
discussion of this and of the implications of chaotic entanglement in
future research investigations is also presented.},

    overcomes both difficulties and apply the resulting approach to address
    three fundamental questions: how {LEs} transform under Lorentz and
    Rindler transformations and under transformations to uniformly rotating
    frames. The answers to the first and third questions show that inertial
    and uniformly rotating observers agree on a characterization of chaos
    based on {LEs.} The second question, on the other hand, is an ill-posed
    problem due to the event horizons inherent to uniformly accelerated
    observers.},

the original problem is reformulated as a partial differential algebraic
equation system by decomposing the solution into a group component and a
spatial shape component, imposing appropriate algebraic constraints on
the decomposition. The system is then projected onto a reduced basis
space. We show that efficient online evaluation of the scheme is possible
and study a numerical example showing its strongly improved performance
in comparison to a scheme without freezing. },

  Abstract                 = {Overdense plasmas are usually opaque to laser light. However, when
    the light is of sufficient intensity to drive electrons in the plasma
    to near light speeds, the plasma becomes transparent. This process?known
    as relativistic transparency?takes just a tenth of a picosecond.
    Yet all studies of relativistic transparency so far have been restricted
    to measurements collected over timescales much longer than this,
    limiting our understanding of the dynamics of this process. Here
    we present time-resolved electric field measurements (with a temporal
    resolution of {\textasciitilde} 50 fs) of the light, initially reflected
    from, and subsequently transmitted through, an expanding overdense
    plasma. Our result provides insight into the dynamics of the transparent-overdense
    regime of relativistic plasmas, which should be useful in the development
    of laser-driven particle accelerators, X-ray sources and techniques
    for controlling the shape and contrast of intense laser pulses.},

    general approach to determine Lyapunov exponents from ensemble- rather
    than time-averages. The approach passes through the identification
    of locally stable and unstable manifolds (the Lyapunov vectors),
    thereby revealing an analogy with generalized synchronization. The
    method is then applied to a periodically forced chaotic oscillator
    to show that the modulus of the Lyapunov exponent associated to the
    phase dynamics increases quadratically with the coupling strength
    and it is therefore different from zero already below the onset of
    phase-synchronization. The analytical calculations are carried out
    for a model, the generalized special flow, that we construct as a
    simplified version of the periodically forced Rossler oscillator.}

    very origins of the subject. This chapter provides an overview of
    some of the main results without any claims of being exhaustive.
    The fundamental problem in the study of zeta functions is to understand
    the analytic domain of such functions or more generally the meromorphic
    domain. In many interesting cases, these domains extend far beyond
    the initial domain of convergence of the series. The chapter discusses
    dynamical variant on the study of the Lefschetz zeta function. This
    serves to illustrate an important theme in the study of dynamical
    zeta functions, namely that local data (e.g., periodic orbits) can
    have a bearing on the global properties of the transformation f.
    In particular, this involves the idea of characterizing closed orbits
    as either twisted or untwisted. The Lefschetz zeta function then
    reflects the balance between these two types of orbits.},

    it has been shown that nonattracting chaotic sets (chaotic saddles)
    are responsible for intermittency in the regularized long-wave equation
    that undergoes a transition to spatiotemporal chaos (STC) via quasiperiodicity
    and temporal chaos. In the present paper, it is demonstrated that
    a similar mechanism is present in the damped Kuramoto-Sivashinsky
    equation. Prior to the onset of STC, a spatiotemporally chaotic saddle
    coexists with a spatially regular attractor. After the transition
    to STC, the chaotic saddle merges with the attractor, generating
    intermittent bursts of STC that dominate the post-transition dynamics.}

    fixed point sets of these symmetries naturally form invariant symplectic
    manifolds that are investigated in this short note. For each k dividing
    n we find k degree of freedom invariant manifolds. They represent
    short wavelength solutions composed of k Fourier modes and can be
    interpreted as embedded lattices with periodic boundary conditions
    and only k particles. Inside these invariant manifolds other invariant
    structures and exact solutions are found which represent for instance
    periodic and quasi-periodic solutions and standing and travelling
    waves. Similar invariant manifolds exist also in the Klein-Gordon
    (KG) lattice and in the thermodynamic and continuum limits.}

    The need to analyze large amounts of multivariate data raises the

    compact representations of high-dimensional data. Here, we introduce
    locally linear embedding {(LLE),} an unsupervised learning algorithm
    that computes low-dimensional, neighborhood-preserving embeddings
    of high-dimensional inputs. Unlike clustering methods for local dimensionality
    reduction, {LLE} maps its inputs into a single global coordinate
    system of lower dimensionality, and its optimizations do not involve
    local minima. By exploiting the local symmetries of linear reconstructions,
    {LLE} is able to learn the global structure of nonlinear manifolds,
    such as those generated by images of faces or documents of text.},

    employs ideas from symmetry reduction in geometric mechanics, and
    involves separating the dynamics on the shape space (which determines
    the overall shape of the solution) from those on the group space
    (which determines the size and scale of the solution). The method
    is computationally tractable as well, allowing one to compute self-similar
    solutions by evolving a dynamical system to a steady state, in a
    scaled reference frame where the self-similarity has been factored
    out. More generally, bifurcation techniques can be used to find self-similar
    solutions, and determine their behaviour as parameters in the equations
    are varied. The method is given for an arbitrary Lie group, providing
    equations for the dynamics on the reduced space, for reconstructing
    the full dynamics and for determining the resulting scaling laws
    for self-similar solutions. We illustrate the technique with a numerical
    example, computing self-similar solutions of the Burgers equation}

  Abstract                 = {The classical theory of linear response applies to
  statistical mechanics close to equilibrium. Away from equilibrium, one
  may describe the microscopic time evolution by a general differentiable
  dynamical system, identify nonequilibrium steady states (NESS) and
  study how these vary under perturbations of the dynamics. Remarkably,
  it turns out that for uniformly hyperbolic dynamical systems (those
  satisfying the 'chaotic hypothesis'), the linear response away from
  equilibrium is very similar to the linear response close to
  equilibrium: the Kramers--Kronig dispersion relations hold, and the
  fluctuation--dispersion theorem survives in a modified form (which takes
  into account the oscillations around the 'attractor' corresponding to
  the NESS). If the chaotic hypothesis does not hold, two new phenomena
  may arise. The first is a violation of linear response in the sense
  that the NESS does not depend differentiably on parameters (but this
  nondifferentiability may be hard to see experimentally). The second
  phenomenon is a violation of the dispersion relations: the
  susceptibility has singularities in the upper half complex plane. These
  'acausal' singularities are actually due to 'energy nonconservation':
  for a small periodic perturbation of the system, the amplitude of the
  linear response is arbitrarily large. This means that the NESS of the
  dynamical system under study is not 'inert' but can give energy to the
  outside world. An 'active' NESS of this sort is very different from an
  equilibrium state, and it would be interesting to see what happens for
  active states to the Gallavotti--Cohen fluctuation theorem.},

    the fluid model is reduced to a Hamiltonian system. The solitary
    waves are homoclinic (grey solitons) or heteroclinic (dark solitons)
    orbits to fixed points. Using a dynamical systems description of
    the Hamiltonian system and a spectral method, we identify a large
    variety of solitary waves, including asymmetric ones, discuss their
    disappearance for certain parameter values and classify them according
    to (i) grey or dark character, (ii) the number of humps of the vector
    potential envelope and (iii) their symmetries. The solutions come
    in continuous families in the parametric V?? plane and extend up
    to velocities that approach the speed of light. The stability of
    certain types of grey solitary waves is investigated with the aid
    of particle-in-cell simulations that demonstrate their propagation

  Abstract                 = {The {Oberbeck-Boussinesq} equations are reduced to a two-dimensional
    form governing convection between two free surfaces maintained at
    a constant temperature difference. These equations are then transformed
    to a set of ordinary differential equations governing the time variations
    of the {double-Fourier} coefficients for the motion and temperature
    fields. Non-linear transfer processes are retained and appear as
    quadratic interactions between the Fourier coefficients. Energy and
    heat transfer relations appropriate to this Fourier resolution, and
    a numerical method for solution from arbitrary initial conditions
    are given. As examples of the method, numerical solutions for a highly
    truncated Fourier representation are presented. These solutions,
    which are for a fixed Prandtl number and variable Rayleigh numbers,
    show the transient growth of convection from small perturbations,
    and in all cases studied approach steady states. The steady states
    obtained agree favorably with steady-state solutions obtained by
    previous investigators.}

  Abstract                 = {We propose a mechanism that leads to efficient acceleration of electrons
    in plasma by two counterpropagating laser pulses. It is triggered
    by stochastic motion of electrons when the laser fields exceed some
    threshold amplitudes, as found in single-electron dynamics. It is
    further confirmed in particle-in-cell simulations. In vacuum or tenuous
    plasma, electron acceleration in the case with two colliding laser
    pulses can be much more efficient than with one laser pulse only.
    In plasma at moderate densities, such as a few percent of the critical
    density, the amplitude of the Raman-backscattered wave is high enough
    to serve as the second counterpropagating pulse to trigger the electron
    stochastic motion. As a result, even with one intense laser pulse
    only, electrons can be heated up to a temperature much higher than
    the corresponding laser ponderomotive potential.},

    The following conclusions are obtained: (1) The statistical properties
    of the Lorenz system can be reduced to those of 1-dimensional Ising
    system with short-range interaction, in other words, the time correlation
    function of the Lorenz system shows no singular long-time behaviour.
    (2) The positive Lyapunov characteristic exponent of the Lorenz system

  Abstract                 = {We study the stability of spatially periodic, nonlinear Vlasov-Poisson
    equilibria as an eigenproblem in a Fourier-Hermite basis (in the
    space and velocity variables, respectively) of finite dimension,
    N. When the advection term in the Vlasov equation is dominant, the
    convergence with N of the eigenvalues is rather slow, limiting the
    applicability of the method. We use the method of spectral deformation
    introduced by Crawford and Hislop Ann. Phys. ({NY)} 189 265 (1989)
    to selectively damp the continuum of neutral modes associated with
    the advection term, thus accelerating convergence. We validate and
    benchmark the performance of our method by reproducing the kinetic
    dispersion relation results for linear (spatially homogeneous) equilibria.
    Finally, we study the stability of a periodic Bernstein-Greene-Kruskal
    mode with multiple phase-space vortices, compare our results with
    numerical simulations of the Vlasov-Poisson system, and show that
    the initial unstable equilibrium may evolve to different asymptotic
    states depending on the way it was perturbed.},

    plasmas, known as self-induced transparency, is revisited for the

    to the predictions of a relativistic cold-fluid model for the transparency
    threshold demonstrates that kinetic effects, such as electron heating,
    can lead to a substantial increase of the effective critical density
    compared to cold-fluid theory. These results are interpreted by a
    study of separatrices in the single-electron phase space corresponding
    to dynamics in the stationary fields predicted by the cold-fluid
    model. It is shown that perturbations due to electron heating exceeding
    a certain finite threshold can force electrons to escape into the
    vacuum, leading to laser pulse propagation. The modification of the
    transparency threshold is linked to the temporal pulse profile, through
    its effect on electron heating.},

    dynamics of large chaotic systems is encoded in their Lyapunov spectra:
    most modes are typically localized on a few degrees of freedom, but
    some are delocalized, acting collectively on the trajectory. For
    globally-coupled maps, we show moreover a quantitative correspondence
    between the collective modes and some of the so-called Perron-Frobenius
    dynamics. Our results imply that the conventional definition of extensivity
    must be changed as soon as collective dynamics sets in.}

    as global climate patterns, stellar spectra, or human gene distributions,

    meaningful low-dimensional structures hidden in their high-dimensional
    observations. The human brain confronts the same problem in everyday
    perception, extracting from its high-dimensional sensory inputs -30,000
    auditory nerve fibers or 106 optic nerve fibers- manageably small
    number of perceptually relevant features. Here we describe an approach
    to solving dimensionality reduction problems that uses easily measured
    local metric information to learn the underlying global geometry
    of a data set. Unlike classical techniques such as principal component
    analysis (PCA) and multidimensional scaling (MDS), our approach is
    capable of discovering the nonlinear degrees of freedom that underlie
    complex natural observations, such as human handwriting or images
    of a face under different viewing conditions. In contrast to previous
    algorithms for nonlinear dimensionality reduction, ours efficiently
    computes a globally optimal solution, and, for an important class
    of data manifolds, is guaranteed to converge asymptotically to the
    true structure.},

  Abstract                 = {The investigation of high-order harmonic generation ({HHG)} of femtosecond
    laser pulses by means of laser-produced plasmas is surveyed. This
    kind of harmonic generation is an alternative to the {HHG} in gases
    and shows significantly higher conversion efficiency. Furthermore,
    with plasma targets there is no limitation on applicable laser intensity
    and thus the generated harmonics can be much more intense. In principle,
    harmonic light may also be generated at relativistic laser intensity,
    in which case their harmonic intensities may even exceed that of
    the focused laser pulse by many orders of magnitude. This phenomenon
    presents new opportunities for applications such as nonlinear optics
    in the extreme ultraviolet region, photoelectron spectroscopy, and
    opacity measurements of high-density matter with high temporal and
    spatial resolution. On the other hand, {HHG} is strongly influenced
    by the laser-plasma interaction itself. In particular, recent results
    show a strong correlation with high-energy electrons generated during
    the interaction process. The harmonics are a promising tool for obtaining
    information not only on plasma parameters such as the local electron
    density, but also on the presence of large electric and magnetic
    fields, plasma waves, and the (electron) transport inside the target.
    This paper reviews the theoretical and experimental progress on {HHG}
    via laser-plasma interactions and discusses the prospects for applying
    {HHG} as a short-wavelength, coherent optical tool.},

  Abstract                 = {Constraints are found on the spatial variation of finite-time Lyapunov
    exponents of two and three-dimensional systems of ordinary differential
    equations. In a chaotic system, finite-time Lyapunov exponents describe
    the average rate of separation, along characteristic directions,
    of neighboring trajectories. The solution of the equations is a coordinate
    transformation that takes initial conditions (the Lagrangian coordinates)
    to the state of the system at a later time (the Eulerian coordinates).
    This coordinate transformation naturally defines a metric tensor,
    from which the Lyapunov exponents and characteristic directions are
    obtained. By requiring that the Riemann curvature tensor vanish for
    the metric tensor (a basic result of differential geometry in a flat
    space), differential constraints relating the finite-time Lyapunov
    exponents to the characteristic directions are derived. These constraints
    are realized with exponential accuracy in time. A consequence of
    the relations is that the finite-time Lyapunov exponents are locally
    small in regions where the curvature of the stable manifold is large,
    which has implications for the efficiency of chaotic mixing in the
    advection-diffusion equation. The constraints also modify previous
    estimates of the asymptotic growth rates of quantities in the dynamo
    problem, such as the magnitude of the induced current.}

    We give a description of the second-order response to perturbations
    in terms of Lagrangian derivatives of the exponents and characteristic
    directions. These derivatives are related to generalised Lyapunov
    exponents, which describe deformations of phase space elements beyond
    ellipsoidal. When the flow is chaotic, care must be taken in evaluating
    the derivatives because of the exponential discrepancy in scale along
    the different characteristic directions. Two matrix decomposition
    methods are used to isolate the directions of stretching, the first
    appropriate in finding the asymptotic behaviour of the derivatives
    analytically, the second better suited to numerical evaluation. The
    derivatives are shown to satisfy differential constraints that are
    realised with exponential accuracy in time. With a suitable reinterpretation,
    the results of the paper are shown to apply to the Eulerian framework

  Abstract                 = { A key a priori information used in 4DVar is the knowledge of the
    system's evolution equations. We propose a method for taking full
    advantage of the knowledge of the system's dynamical instabilities
    in order to improve the quality of the analysis. We present an algorithm,
    four-dimensional variational assimilation in the unstable subspace
    (4DVar-AUS), that consists in confining in this subspace the increment
    of the control variable. The existence of an optimal subspace dimension
    for this confinement is hypothesized. Theoretical arguments in favor
    of the present approach are supported by numerical experiments in
    a simple perfect non-linear model scenario. It is found that the
    RMS analysis error is a function of the dimension N of the subspace
    where the analysis is confined and is minimum for N approximately
    equal to the dimension of the unstable and neutral manifold. For
    all assimilation windows, from 1 to 5 days, 4DVar-AUS performs better
    than standard 4DVar. In the presence of observational noise, the
    4DVar solution, while being closer to the observations, if farther
    away from the truth. The implementation of 4DVar-AUS does not require
    the adjoint integration. }

  Abstract                 = {A periodic orbit analysis in the Lorenz system and the study of the
    properties of the associated tangent linear equations are performed.
    A set of vectors are found that satisfy the Oseledec (1968) theorem
    and reduce to Floquet eigenvectors in the particular case of a periodic
    orbit. These vectors, called Lyapunov vectors, can be considered
    the generalization to aperiodic orbits of the normal modes of the
    instability problem and are not necessarily mutually orthogonal.
    The relation between singular vectors and Lyapunov vectors is clarified.
    The mechanism responsible for super-Lyapunov growth is shown to be
    related to the nonorthogonality of Lyapunov vectors. The leading
    Lyapunov vectors, as defined here, as well as the asymptotic final
    singular vectors, are tangent to the attractor, while the leading
    initial singular vectors, in general, point away from it. Perturbations
    that are on the attractor can be found in the subspace of the leading
    Lyapunov vectors.}

    containing streamwise vortices. This bifurcation is followed by several
    others giving rise to a fascinating series of stable and unstable
    steady states of different symmetries and wavelengths. First, the
    backwards-bifurcating branch reverses direction and becomes stable
    near Re = 200. Then, the spanwise reflection symmetry is broken,
    leading to two asymmetric branches which are themselves destabilized
    at Re = 420. Above this Reynolds number, time evolution leads first
    to a metastable state whose spanwise wavelength is halved and then
    to complicated time-dependent behavior. These features are in agreement
    with experiments.}

    conveniently defined creation-annihilation operators. With these
    operators at hand, we are able to construct transverse excited resonances
    at a given Bohr-quantized energy. Then, by requiring minimum energy
    dispersion we obtain solutions in terms of even or odd transverse
    excitations. These wavefunctions, which are constructed in the vicinity
    of a periodic orbit with maximum energy localization, provide a precise
    definition of a scar function . These scar functions acquire, in
    the semiclassical limit, the hyperbolic structure characteristic
    of unstable periodic orbits.},

    sources emitting a collection of angularly well-separated light beams,

    opens the way to a new generation of light sources, particularly
    suitable for attosecond pump-probe experiments, and provides a new

  Abstract                 = {Classical chaotic systems with symbolic dynamics but strong pruning
    present a particular challenge for the application of semiclassical
    quantization methods. In the present study we show that the technique
    of periodic orbit quantization by harmonic inversion of trace formulae,
    which does not rely on the existence of a complete symbolic dynamics
    or other specific properties, lends itself ideally to calculating
    semiclassical eigenvalues from periodic orbit data even in strongly
    pruned systems. We apply the harmonic inversion technique to cross-correlated
    periodic orbit sums, which allows us to reduce the required number
    of orbits. The power, and the limitations, of the method in its present
    form are demonstrated for the closed three-disk billiard as a prime
    example of a classically chaotic bound system with strong pruning.}

    matter can lead to the emission of a train of sub-laser-cycle?attosecond?bursts
    of short-wavelength radiation. Much effort has been devoted to producing
    isolated attosecond pulses, as these are better suited to real-time
    imaging of fundamental electronic processes. Successful methods developed
    so far rely on confining the nonlinear interaction to a single sub-cycle
    event. Here, we demonstrate for the first time a simpler and more
    universal approach to this problem, applied to nonlinear laser?plasma
    interactions. By rotating the instantaneous wavefront direction of
    an intense few-cycle laser field as it interacts with a solid-density
    plasma, we separate the nonlinearly generated attosecond pulse train
    into multiple beams of isolated attosecond pulses propagating in
    different and controlled directions away from the plasma surface.
    This unique method produces a manifold of isolated attosecond pulses,
    ideally synchronized for initiating and probing ultrafast electron
    motion in matter.},

  Abstract                 = {The conditions under which there exists a uniformly hyperbolic invariant
    set for the generalized {H\'enon} map. It is proved that for certain
    parameter regions the map has a Smale horseshoe and a uniformly hyperbolic
    invariant set on which it is topologically conjugate to the two-sided
    fullshift on two symbols.},
