  pages = {303--341},
  abstract = {We develop and test two novel computational approaches for predicting
	the mean linear response of a chaotic dynamical system to small change
	in external forcing via the fluctuation-dissipation theorem. Unlike
	the earlier work in developing fluctuation-dissipation theorem-type
	computational strategies for chaotic nonlinear systems with forcing
	and dissipation, the new methods are based on the theory of Sinai-Ruelle-Bowen
	probability measures, which commonly describe the equilibrium state
	of such dynamical systems. The new methods take into account the
	fact that the dynamics of chaotic nonlinear forced-dissipative systems
	often reside on chaotic fractal attractors, where the classical quasi-Gaussian
	formula of the fluctuation-dissipation theorem often fails to produce
	satisfactory response prediction, especially in dynamical regimes
	with weak and moderate degrees of chaos. A simple new low-dimensional
	chaotic nonlinear forced-dissipative model is used to study the response
	of both linear and nonlinear functions to small external forcing
	in a range of dynamical regimes with an adjustable degree of chaos.
	We demonstrate that the two new methods are remarkably superior to
	the classical fluctuation-dissipation formula with quasi-Gaussian
	approximation in weakly and moderately chaotic dynamical regimes,
	for both linear and nonlinear response functions. One straightforward
	algorithm gives excellent results for short-time response while the
	other algorithm, based on systematic rational approximation, improves
	the intermediate and long time response predictions.},

	different approaches of control design. The first approach assumes
	that the closed loop system is affine in the control and that the

	system that minimize a quadratic cost function. The second approach
	is more general; here the actuation need not be equivariant, but
	the actuators can be translated in the symmetry direction. The controller
	resulting from this approach leaves the dynamics associated with
	the symmetry variable unchanged. Both approaches are simple to implement,
	as they use standard tools available from linear control theory.
	We illustrate the approaches on three examples: a rotationally invariant
	planar {ODE,} an inverted pendulum on a cart, and the {Kuramoto-Sivashinsky}

  pages = {199--219},
  abstract = {A rigorous proof is given in the standard map for the existence of
	chaotic trajectories with unbounded momenta for large enough coupling
	constant k. The obtained chaotic trajectories correspond to stationary
	configurations of the Frenkel-Kontorowa model with a finite (non-zero)
	photon gap (called gap parameter in dimensionless units). This property
	implies that the trajectory (or the configuration {ui}) can be uniquely
	continued as a uniformly continuous function of the model parameter
	k in some neighborhood of the initial configuration. A non-zero gap
	parameter implies that the Lyapunov coefficient is strictly positive
	(when it is defined). In addition, the existence of dilating and
	contracting manifolds is proven for these chaotic trajectories. ``Exotic''?
	trajectories such as ballistic trajectories are also proven to exist
	as a consequence of these theorems. The concept of anti-integrability
	emerges from these theorems. In the anti-integrable limit which can
	be only defined for a discrete time dynamical system, the coordinates
	of the trajectory at time i do not depend on the coordinates at time
	i - 1. Thus, at this singular limit, the existence of chaotic trajectories
	is trivial and the dynamical system reduces to a Bernoulli shift.
	It appears that the chaotic trajectories of dynamical systems originate
	by continuity from those which exists at the anti-integrable limits.},

the Poincar\' map we use the Brent?s method and in the integration process
a Taylor series method that permits us to compute the orbits using
extended precision, something highly interesting in the case of unstable
periodic orbits. These facts have permitted us to obtain many more
periodic orbits than other researchers. Once the families of periodic
orbits have been found we study the bifurcations just by comparing with
the stability index and the classical generic bifurcations for
Hamiltonian systems with and without symmetries. We illustrate the method
with four important classical Hamiltonian problems. "

abstract = "The classical field theories that underlie the quantum
treatments of the electromagnetic, weak, and strong forces share a
peculiar feature: specifying the initial state of the field determines
the evolution of some degrees of freedom of the theory while leaving the
evolution of some others wholly arbitrary. This strongly suggests that
some of the variables of the standard state space lack physical
content?intuitively, the space of states of such a theory is of higher
dimension than the corresponding space of genuine physical possibilities.
The structure of such theories can helpfully be characterized in terms of
the action of symmetry groups on their space of states; and the
conceptual problems surrounding their strange behavior can be sharpened
in light of the observation that it is usually possible to eliminate the
redundant variables associated with these symmetries?which turn out to be
precisely those variables whose evolution is unconstrained by the
dynamical laws of the theory. This paper discusses this approach, uses it
to frame questions about the interpretation of classical gauge theories,
and to reflect (pessimistically) on our prospects of reaching
satisfactory answers to these questions. "

	the curvature of the pullback of the momentum map to the Lie algebra
	determines the normal form for the homoclinic bifurcation. There
	is also an induced directional geometric phase in the homoclinic
	bifurcation. The backbone of the analysis is the use of singularity

	of the momentum map. The theory is constructive and generalities
	are given for symmetric Hamiltonian systems on a vector space of

	functions on the state space to: (a) identify invariant sets in the
	state space, and (b) to form coherent structures by aggregating invariant
	sets that are similar across multiple spatial scales. First, we construct
	the ergodic quotient, the object obtained by mapping trajectories
	to the space of the trajectory averages of a function basis on the
	state space. Second, we endow the ergodic quotient with a metric
	structure that successfully captures how similar the invariant sets
	are in the state space. Finally, we parametrize the ergodic quotient
	using intrinsic diffusion modes on it. By segmenting the ergodic
	quotient based on the diffusion modes, we extract coherent features
	in the state space of the dynamical system. The algorithm is validated
	by analyzing the Arnold-Beltrami-Childress flow, which was the test-bed
	for alternative approaches: the Ulam's approximation of the transfer
	operator and the computation of Lagrangian Coherent Structures. Furthermore,
	we explain how the method extends the Poincar\'e map analysis for
	periodic flows. As a demonstration, we apply the method to a periodically-driven
	three-dimensional Hill's vortex flow, discovering unknown coherent
	structures in its state space.},

	The computation of orthogonal Gram-Schmidt vectors requires multiplication

	the particle count). This expense has limited such calculations to
	relatively small systems and short time scales. Here, we detail two
	implementations of an algorithm for computing Gram-Schmidt vectors.
	The first is a distributed-memory message-passing method using Scalapack.
	The second uses the newly-released \{MAGMA\} library for GPUs. We
	compare the performance of both codes for Lennard-Jones fluids from
	N = 100 to 1300 between Intel Nahalem/Infiniband \{DDR\} and \{NVIDIA\}
	\{C2050\} architectures. To our best knowledge, these are the largest
	systems for which the Gram-Schmidt Lyapunov vectors have been computed,
	and the first time their calculation has been GPU-accelerated. We
	conclude that Lyapunov vector calculations can be significantly extended
	in length and time by leveraging the power of GPU-accelerated linear

	group. These periodic orbits correspond to trajectories on the full
	phase space which are not necessarily periodic, but whose end points
	are related by symmetry. Examples: the stadium billiard, a particle
	in a periodic potential, the Sinai billiard, the quartic oscillator,
	and the rotational spectrum of SF6.},

	dynamical systems when the underlying symbolic dynamics is under

	show an intricate structure of the grammar rules that may lead to
	a non-smooth dependence of global observables on parameters changes.
	A paradigmatic example is the fractal diffusion coefficient arising
	in a simple piecewise linear one-dimensional map of the real line.
	Using the Baladi-Ruelle generalization of the Milnor-Thurnston kneading
	determinant, we provide the exact dynamical zeta function for such
	a map and compute the diffusion coefficient from its smallest zero.},

	framework that greatly simplifies analytical and numerical investigations
	of the escape rate in open systems. As an example, we explicitly
	derive the exact size- and position-dependent escape rate in a Markov
	case for holes of finite-size. Moreover, a general relation between
	the transfer operators of the closed and corresponding open systems,
	together with the generating function of the probability of return
	to the hole is derived. This relation is then used to compute the
	small hole asymptotic behavior, in terms of readily calculable quantities.
	As an example we derive logarithmic corrections in the second order
	term. Being valid for Markov systems, our framework can find application
	in many areas of the physical sciences such as information theory,
	network theory, quantum Weyl law and, via Ulam's method, can be used

	we address the problems of applying this formalism to bound chaotic
	systems, caused by e.g. intermittency and non-completeness of the
	symbolic dynamics. For bound intermittent systems we derive an approximation
	of the zeta function. With the aid of this zeta function it is argued
	that bound systems with long time tails have branch cuts in the zeta
	function and traces (of the evolution operator) approaching unity
	as a power law. We also show that the dominant time scale can be
	much longer than the period of the shortest periodic orbit, as is,
	for example, the case for the hyperbola billiard. Isolated zeros
	of the zeta function for the hyperbola billiard are evaluated by
	means of a cycle expansion. Crucial for the success of this approach
	is the identification of a sequence of periodic orbit responsible
	for a logarithmic branch cut in the zeta function. Semiclassical
	implications are briefly discussed.},

the Kuramoto?Sivashinsky equation (KSe) is undertaken from a dynamical
systems? point of view. A recently devised variational method is employed
and one new variant is developed. At fixed system size L = 43.5 ,
important equilibria are identified and shown to organize the dynamics.
The first integral of the steady \{KSe\} leads to a 3D dynamical system
with an integration constant c. At a typical value of c = 0.40194 , four
simplest cycles are identified and used as basic building blocks to
construct longer cycles. The symbolic dynamics based on trajectory
topology are very effective in classifying all short periodic orbits. The
probation of the return map on a chosen Poincar\'e section shows the
complexity of the dynamics and the bifurcation of building blocks
provides a chart to look for possible cycles at given periods. The
current study may be conveniently adapted to the identification and
classification of cycles in other nonlinear systems. "

continuous symmetries. For general maps, in contrast to the symplectic
case, the existence of a symmetry no longer implies the existence of an
invariant. Conversely, a map with an invariant need not have a symmetry.
We show that when a symmetry flow has a global Poincaré section there are
coordinates in which the map takes a reduced, skew-product form, and
hence allows for reduction of dimensionality. We show that the reduction
of a volume-preserving map again is volume preserving. Finally we sharpen
the Noether theorem for symplectic maps. A number of illustrative
examples are discussed and the method is compared with traditional
reduction techniques.} }

  abstract = {A traditional subject in statistical physics is the linear response
	of a molecular dynamical system to changes in an external forcing
	agency, e.g. the Ohmic response of an electrical conductor to an
	applied electric field. For molecular systems the linear response
	matrices, such as the electrical conductivity, can be represented
	by Green-Kubo formulae as improper time-integrals of 2-time correlation
	functions in the system. Recently, Ruelle has extended the Green-Kubo
	formalism to describe the statistical, steady-state response of a
	'sufficiently chaotic' nonlinear dynamical system to changes in its
	parameters. This formalism potentially has a number of important
	applications. For instance, in studies of global warming one wants
	to calculate the response of climate-mean temperature to a change
	in the atmospheric concentration of greenhouse gases. In general,
	a climate sensitivity is defined as the linear response of a long-time
	average to changes in external forces. We show that Ruelle's linear
	response formula can be computed by an ensemble adjoint technique
	and that this algorithm is equivalent to a more standard ensemble
	adjoint method proposed by Lea, Allen and Haine to calculate climate
	sensitivities. In a numerical implementation for the 3-variable,
	chaotic Lorenz model it is shown that the two methods perform very
	similarly. However, because of a power-law tail in the histogram
	of adjoint gradients their sum over ensemble members becomes a L?vy
	flight , and the central limit theorem breaks down. The law of large
	numbers still holds and the ensemble-average converges to the desired
	sensitivity, but only very slowly, as the number of samples is increased.
	We discuss the implications of this example more generally for ensemble
	adjoint techniques and for the important practical issue of calculating
	climate sensitivities.},

Abstract = {Prequantum dynamics was introduced in the 70s by
Kostant, Souriau and Kirillov as an intermediate between
classical and quantum dynamics. In common with the classical
dynamics, prequantum dynamics transports functions on phase
space, but adds some phases which are important in quantum
interference effects. In the case of hyperbolic dynamical
systems, it is believed that the study of the prequantum
dynamics will give a better understanding of the quantum
interference effects for large time, and of their statistical
properties. We consider a linear hyperbolic map which generates
a chaotic dynamical system on
the torus. The dynamics is lifted to a prequantum fiber bundle.
This gives a unitary prequantum (partially hyperbolic) map. We
calculate its resonances and show that they are related to the
quantum eigenvalues. A remarkable consequence is that quantum
dynamics emerges from long-term behavior of prequantum
dynamics. We present trace formulas, and discuss perspectives
of this approach in the nonlinear case.}

	Thus, the production of energetic particle beams currently requires

	suppressed and that the quality of the electron beams can be dramatically
	enhanced. Within a length of 3 mm, the laser drives a plasma bubble
	that traps and accelerates plasma electrons. The resulting electron
	beam is extremely collimated and quasi-monoenergetic, with a high

	problems of nonlinear science in both numerical computations and
	experimental measures. In this paper, a new method is proposed to
	detect the UPOs in a non-Lyapunov way. Firstly three special techniques
	are added to quantum-behaved particle swarm optimization (QPSO),
	a novel mbest particle, contracting the searching space self-adaptively
	and boundaries restriction (NCB), then the new method NCB--QPSO is
	proposed. It can maintain an effective search mechanism with fine
	equilibrium between exploitation and exploration. Secondly, the problems
	of detecting the UPOs are converted into a non-negative functions'
	minimization through a proper translation in a non-Lyapunov way.
	Thirdly the simulations to 6 benchmark optimization problems and
	different high order UPOs of 5 classic nonlinear maps are done by
	the proposed method. And the results show that NCB--QPSO is a successful
	method in detecting the UPOs, and it has the advantages of fast convergence,
	high precision and robustness.},

	electric field of a plasma wave (the wakefield) driven by an intense
	laser, have demonstrated accelerating electric fields of hundreds
	of {GV} m-1 (refs 1?3). These fields are thousands of times greater
	than those achievable in conventional radio-frequency accelerators,
	spurring interest in laser accelerators as compact next-generation
	sources of energetic electrons and radiation. To date, however, acceleration
	distances have been severely limited by the lack of a controllable
	method for extending the propagation distance of the focused laser
	pulse. The ensuing short acceleration distance results in low-energy
	beams with 100 per cent electron energy spread, which limits potential
	applications. Here we demonstrate a laser accelerator that produces
	electron beams with an energy spread of a few per cent, low emittance
	and increased energy (more than 109 electrons above 80 {MeV).} Our
	technique involves the use of a preformed plasma density channel
	to guide a relativistically intense laser, resulting in a longer
	propagation distance. The results open the way for compact and tunable
	high-brightness sources of electrons and radiation.},

the evolution of the probability densities. We solve this
equation in the linear regime and compute the heat conductivity

Green-Kubo formula. We demonstrate the validity of the
molecular chaos hypothesis by comparing our theoretical
predictions to the results of numerical simulations performed
on a new class of models, which are defocusing chaotic
billiards, likened to higher-dimensional stadia.},

	separation points on the frontier of the mixing region leads to non-self-similar

  abstract = {The theory of chaotic dynamical systems gives many tools that can
	be used in climate studies. The widely used ones are the Lyapunov
	exponents, the Kolmogorov entropy and the attractor dimension characterizing
	global quantities of a system. Another potentially useful tool from
	dynamical system theory arises from the fact that the local analysis
	of a system probability distribution function (PDF) can be accomplished
	by using a procedure that involves an expansion in terms of unstable
	periodic orbits (UPOs). The system measure (or its statistical characteristics)
	is approximated as a weighted sum over the orbits. The weights are
	inversely proportional to the orbit instability characteristics so
	that the least unstable orbits make larger contributions to the PDF.
	Consequently, one can expect some relationship between the least
	unstable orbits and the local maxima of the system PDF. As a result,
	the most probable system trajectories (or `circulation regimes' in
	some sense) may be explained in terms of orbits. For the special
	classes of chaotic dynamical systems, there is a strict theory guaranteeing
	the accuracy of this approach. However, a typical atmospheric model
	may not qualify for these theorems. In our study, we will try to
	apply the idea of UPO expansion to the simple atmospheric system
	based on the barotropic vorticity equation of the sphere. We will
	check how well orbits approximate the system attractor, its statistical
	characteristics and PDF. The connection of the most probable states
	of the system with the least unstable periodic orbits will also be
	analysed.},

  volume = {23},
  pages = {345--367},
  abstract = {Unstable periodic trajectories of a chaotic dissipative system belong
	to the attractor of the system and are its important characteristics.
	Many chaotic systems have an infinite number of periodic solutions
	forming the skeleton of the system attractor. This allows one to
	approximate the system trajectories and statistical characteristics
	by using periodic solutions. The least unstable orbits may generate
	local maxima of the system state distribution functions on the attractor.
	With respect to atmospheric systems this means that orbits may determine
	dynamic circulation regimes and typical variability modes of the
	system. In some cases, given a small number of periodic solutions,
	one can describe the dynamics on the attractor of the system and
	the basic statistics with sufficient precision. Thus, the information
	concerning periodic trajectories of a particular dynamic system may
	be very important for analysis of its behavior. A search for periodic
	trajectories is reduced to the solution of a system of nonlinear
	equations with respect to the initial condition of an orbit and its
	period. The choice of a numerical solution method and an initial
	guess is an important aspect here. In this paper we consider the
	problem of the calculation of periodic trajectories for a barotropic
	model of the atmosphere. Several methods for determination of periodic
	orbits of the model are formulated and implemented, including the
	Newton method with step suppression, the Newton method with a second
	order tensor correction, the quasi-Newton method with step suppression,
	the quasi-Newton method with minimization of the error functional
	and approximate Hessian inversion by the LBFG scheme and the GMRES
	method. A comparison of the efficiency of these numerical methods
	and different choices of initial conditions is performed. Various
	factors influencing the rate of convergence of the methods are considered.},

	transition drastically affects the transport efficiency of mass,

	dynamics of nonhyperbolic chaotic 2-D maps and 3-flows is presented.
	Noise in these systems can have dramatic effects on the invariant
	measure of the system. In regions of homoclinic tangencies perturbations
	are transported away from the neighborhood of the attractor, leading
	to deformations which can be one to two orders of magnitude larger
	than the noise level. A qualitative understanding is attained by
	a study of the universal properties of the unstable and stable foliation
	of the phase space in the vicinity of homoclinic tangencies. Through
	the investigation of nontrivial structures of the tangent space at
	homoclinic tangencies related to the non-normal Jacobians we obtain
	a quantitative description of these noise-induced deformations of
	the attractor. Local expansion rates which are much larger than the
	maximal Lyapunov exponent can be used as a measure of the system's
	structural instability under perturbations. We exemplify our general
	results on the {H\'enon}, Ikeda and Duffing system. A new and effective
	algorithm to calculate the homoclinic tangencies in the entire phase
	space based on the results of this paper is presented.},

	The slower time behavior permits the use of projective and coarse

	used to illustrate the coarse-grained method. A simple, one-dimensional

	The efficiency of projective integration in the co-evolving frame

	two modes of using the {K-L} decomposition: As an analytic and synthetic

	points and stable and unstable manifolds in a parameter regime with
	structurally stable homoclinic orbits (a=17.75). Choosing the data

	events, we can analyze a more complicated intermittent regime at
	a=68. We establish that the spatially localized oscillations around
	a so called `strange' fixed point which are considered as fore-runners
	of spatially concentrated zones of turbulence are in fact created
	by a very specific limit cycle (a=83.75) which, for a=87, bifurcates
	into a modulated traveling wave. Using the {K-L} decomposition synthetically

  abstract = {We present a derivation, a physical explanation and applications of
	cycle expansions in different dynamical systems, ranging from simple
	one-dimensional maps to turbulence in fluids. Cycle expansion is
	a newly devised powerful tool for computing averages of physical
	observables in nonlinear chaotic systems which combines many innovative
	ideas developed in dynamical systems, such as hyperbolicity, invariant
	manifolds, symbolic dynamics, measure theory and thermodynamic formalism.
	The concept of cycle expansion has a deep root in theoretical physics,
	bearing a close analogy to cumulant expansion in statistical physics
	and effective action functional in quantum field theory, the essence
	of which is to represent a physical system in a hierarchical way
	by utilizing certain multiplicative structures such that the dominant
	parts of physical observables are captured by compact, maneuverable
	objects while minor detailed variations are described by objects
	with a larger space and time scale. The technique has been successfully
	applied to many low-dimensional dynamical systems and much effort
	has recently been made to extend its use to spatially extended systems.
	For one-dimensional systems such as the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation,
	the method turns out to be very effective while for more complex
	real-world systems including the Navier-Stokes equation, the method
	is only starting to yield its first fruits and much more work is
	needed to enable practical computations. However, the experience
	and knowledge accumulated so far is already very useful to a large
	set of research problems. Several such applications are briefly described
	in what follows. As more research effort is devoted to the study
	of complex dynamics of nonlinear systems, cycle expansion will undergo
	a fast development and find wide applications.},

  pages = {523--532},
  abstract = {This paper addresses some fundamental methodological issues concerning
	the sensitivity analysis of chaotic geophysical systems. We show,
	using the Lorenz system as an example, that a naive approach to variational
	(``adjoint'') sensitivity analysis is of limited utility. Applied
	to trajectories which are long relative to the predictability time
	scales of the system, cumulative error growth means that adjoint
	results diverge exponentially from the ``macroscopic climate sensitivity''(that
	is, the sensitivity of time-averaged properties of the system to
	finite-amplitude perturbations). This problem occurs even for time-averaged
	quantities and given infinite computing resources. Alternatively,
	applied to very short trajectories, the adjoint provides an incorrect
	estimate of the sensitivity, even if averaged over large numbers
	of initial conditions, because a finite time scale is required for
	the model climate to respond fully to certain perturbations. In the
	Lorenz (1963) system, an intermediate time scale is found on which
	an ensemble of adjoint gradients can give a reasonably accurate (O(10%))
	estimate of the macroscopic climate sensitivity. While this ensemble-adjoint
	approach is unlikely to be reliable for more complex systems, it
	may provide useful guidance in identifying important parameter-combinations
	to be explored further through direct finite-amplitude perturbations.},

	now reach focused intensities of more than 1019 W cm-2 at high repetition
	rates. Such lasers are capable of producing beams of energetic electrons,
	protons and -rays. Relativistic electrons are generated through the
	breaking of large-amplitude relativistic plasma waves created in
	the wake of the laser pulse as it propagates through a plasma, or
	through a direct interaction between the laser field and the electrons
	in the plasma. However, the electron beams produced from previous
	laser?plasma experiments have a large energy spread, limiting their
	use for potential applications. Here we report high-resolution energy
	measurements of the electron beams produced from intense laser?plasma
	interactions, showing that?under particular plasma conditions?it
	is possible to generate beams of relativistic electrons with low
	divergence and a small energy spread (less than three per cent).
	The monoenergetic features were observed in the electron energy spectrum
	for plasma densities just above a threshold required for breaking
	of the plasma wave. These features were observed consistently in
	the electron spectrum, although the energy of the beam was observed
	to vary from shot to shot. If the issue of energy reproducibility
	can be addressed, it should be possible to generate ultrashort monoenergetic
	electron bunches of tunable energy, holding great promise for the
	future development of 'table-top' particle accelerators.},

provide low-dimensional visualizations of the dynamics and identify
quasiperiodic and homoclinic orbits, linking the latter to

	paths in a class of three-dimensional incompressible fluid flows.
	In this paper we study three-dimensionalvolume preserving vector
	fields that are invariant under the action of a one-parameter symmetry
	group whose infinitesimal generator is autonomous and volume-preserving.
	We show that there exists a coordinate system in which the vector
	field assumes a simple form. In particular, the evolution of two
	of the coordinates is governed by a time-dependent, one-degree-of-freedom
	Hamiltonian system with the evolution of the remaining coordinate
	being governed by a first-order differential equation that depends
	only on the other two coordinates and time. The new coordinates depend
	only on the symmetry group of the vector field. Therefore they arefield-independent.
	The coordinate transformation is constructive. If the vector field
	is time-independent, then it possesses an integral of motion. Moreover,
	we show that the system can be further reduced toaction-angle-angle
	coordinates. These are analogous to the familiar action-angle variables
	from Hamiltonian mechanics and are quite useful for perturbative
	studies of the class of systems we consider. In fact, we show how
	our coordinate transformation puts us in a position to apply recent
	extensions of the {Kolmogorov-Arnold-Moser} {(KAM)} theorem for three-dimensional,
	volume-preserving maps as well as three-dimensional versions of Melnikov's
	method. We discuss the integrability of the class of flows considered,
	and draw an analogy with Clebsch variables in fluid mechanics.}

	Through a weakly nonlinear analysis that assumes weak periodic forcing,

	of the two mechanisms are reduced to a system of two coupled amplitude
	equations describing the resonant response. The predictions that
	follow from an analysis of the reduced equations, as well as performance
	benefits due to the coupling of the two mechanisms, are discussed

approximation of the solution manifolds of parameterized nonlinear
evolution problems, in particular in hyperbolic regimes with moving
discontinuities. Given the action of a Lie group on the solution space,
the original problem is reformulated as a partial differential algebraic
equation system by decomposing the solution into a group component and a
spatial shape component, imposing appropriate algebraic constraints on
the decomposition. The system is then projected onto a reduced basis
space. We show that efficient online evaluation of the scheme is possible
and study a numerical example showing its strongly improved performance
in comparison to a scheme without freezing. "

	The fundamental problem in the study of zeta functions is to understand
	the analytic domain of such functions or more generally the meromorphic
	domain. In many interesting cases, these domains extend far beyond
	the initial domain of convergence of the series. The chapter discusses
	dynamical variant on the study of the Lefschetz zeta function. This
	serves to illustrate an important theme in the study of dynamical
	zeta functions, namely that local data (e.g., periodic orbits) can
	have a bearing on the global properties of the transformation f.
	In particular, this involves the idea of characterizing closed orbits
	as either twisted or untwisted. The Lefschetz zeta function then
	reflects the balance between these two types of orbits.},

	scaled reference frame where the self-similarity has been factored
	out. More generally, bifurcation techniques can be used to find self-similar
	solutions, and determine their behaviour as parameters in the equations
	are varied. The method is given for an arbitrary Lie group, providing
	equations for the dynamics on the reduced space, for reconstructing
	the full dynamics and for determining the resulting scaling laws
	for self-similar solutions. We illustrate the technique with a numerical
	example, computing self-similar solutions of the Burgers equation}

  abstract = {We present a method for applying the {Karhunen-Lo\'eve} decomposition

	contribute to the general procedure of removing variables associated
	with the symmetry of a problem, and related ideas have been used
	in previous works both to identify coherent structures in solutions
	of {PDEs,} and to derive low-order models via Galerkin projection.
	The main result of this paper is to derive a simple and easily implementable
	set of reconstruction equations which close the system of {ODEs}
	produced by Galerkin projection. The geometric interpretation of
	the method closely parallels techniques used in geometric phases
	and reconstruction techniques in geometric mechanics. We apply the
	method to the {Kuramoto-Sivashinsky} equation and are able to derive
	accurate models of considerably lower dimension than are possible

In particular, we stress the importance of accounting for both the nonlinear frequency shift of the electron plasma wave and the growth of sidebands, in order to understand what stops the coherent growth of Raman scattering. Using a Bernstein-Greene-Kruskal approach, we provide an estimate for the maximum amplitude reached by a {BSRS-driven} plasma wave after the phase of monotonic growth. This estimate is in very good agreement with the results from kinetic simulations of stimulated Raman scattering using both a Vlasov and a Particle in Cell code. Our analysis, which may be generalized to a multidimensional geometry, should provide a means to estimate the limits of backward Raman amplification or the effectiveness of strategies that aim at strongly reducing Raman reflectivity in a fusion plasma.},

  abstract = {Constraints are found on the spatial variation of finite-time Lyapunov
	exponents of two and three-dimensional systems of ordinary differential
	equations. In a chaotic system, finite-time Lyapunov exponents describe
	the average rate of separation, along characteristic directions,
	of neighboring trajectories. The solution of the equations is a coordinate
	transformation that takes initial conditions (the Lagrangian coordinates)
	to the state of the system at a later time (the Eulerian coordinates).
	This coordinate transformation naturally defines a metric tensor,
	from which the Lyapunov exponents and characteristic directions are
	obtained. By requiring that the Riemann curvature tensor vanish for
	the metric tensor (a basic result of differential geometry in a flat
	space), differential constraints relating the finite-time Lyapunov
	exponents to the characteristic directions are derived. These constraints
	are realized with exponential accuracy in time. A consequence of
	the relations is that the finite-time Lyapunov exponents are locally
	small in regions where the curvature of the stable manifold is large,
	which has implications for the efficiency of chaotic mixing in the
	advection-diffusion equation. The constraints also modify previous
	estimates of the asymptotic growth rates of quantities in the dynamo

	We give a description of the second-order response to perturbations

	exponents, which describe deformations of phase space elements beyond
	ellipsoidal. When the flow is chaotic, care must be taken in evaluating
	the derivatives because of the exponential discrepancy in scale along
	the different characteristic directions. Two matrix decomposition
	methods are used to isolate the directions of stretching, the first

	analytically, the second better suited to numerical evaluation. The

	in order to improve the quality of the analysis. We present an algorithm,
	four-dimensional variational assimilation in the unstable subspace
	(4DVar-AUS), that consists in confining in this subspace the increment
	of the control variable. The existence of an optimal subspace dimension
	for this confinement is hypothesized. Theoretical arguments in favor
	of the present approach are supported by numerical experiments in
	a simple perfect non-linear model scenario. It is found that the
	RMS analysis error is a function of the dimension N of the subspace
	where the analysis is confined and is minimum for N approximately
	equal to the dimension of the unstable and neutral manifold. For
	all assimilation windows, from 1 to 5 days, 4DVar-AUS performs better
	than standard 4DVar. In the presence of observational noise, the
	4DVar solution, while being closer to the observations, if farther
	away from the truth. The implementation of 4DVar-AUS does not require
	the adjoint integration. }

	A set of vectors are found that satisfy the Oseledec (1968) theorem

	the generalization to aperiodic orbits of the normal modes of the

	The relation between singular vectors and Lyapunov vectors is clarified.
	The mechanism responsible for super-Lyapunov growth is shown to be
	related to the nonorthogonality of Lyapunov vectors. The leading
	Lyapunov vectors, as defined here, as well as the asymptotic final
	singular vectors, are tangent to the attractor, while the leading

	similarity and difference, especially with respect to the influence

	show that in both Hamiltonian and dissipative systems HLMs formerly
	detected via OLVs survive if CLVs are used instead. Moreover, the
	previous classification of two universality classes works for CLVs
	as well, i.e., the dispersion relation is linear for Hamiltonian
	systems and quadratic for dissipative systems, respectively. The
	significance of HLMs changes in different ways for Hamiltonian and
	dissipative systems with the replacement of OLVs with CLVs. For general
	dissipative systems with nonhyperbolic dynamics the long-wavelength
	structure in Lyapunov vectors corresponding to near-zero Lyapunov
	exponents is strongly reduced if CLVs are used instead, whereas for
	highly hyperbolic dissipative systems the significance of HLMs is
	nearly identical for CLVs and OLVs. In contrast the HLM significance
	of Hamiltonian systems is always comparable for CLVs and OLVs irrespective
	of hyperbolicity. We also find that in Hamiltonian systems different
	symmetry relations between conjugate pairs are observed for CLVs
	and OLVs. Especially, CLVs in a conjugate pair are statistically
	indistinguishable in consequence of the microreversibility of Hamiltonian
	systems. Transformation properties of Lyapunov exponents, CLVs, and

  abstract = {The complex interactions between spatial and temporal components of
	the dynamics, known as spatiotemporal chaos, only recently begun
	to be studied using ideas from fundamental dynamical systems theory
	(Temam, 1988; Goren et al. 1995; Christiansen et al. 1997). The present
	dissertation is primarily interested in studying the appearance of
	global bifurcations in two specific physical examples, a laser with
	an injected signal, and a catalytic reaction on a platinum surface.
	Characteristic of these bifurcations is the presence of a highly
	degenerate .... One of the main motivations to study these equations
	is that some of them display spatiotemporal chaos, which in many
	ways, resembles turbulence in fluid dynamics. Recently, different
	efforts to uncover the dynamical origin for these complex states
	have been developing (Goren et al. 1995; Christiansen et al. 1997).}
