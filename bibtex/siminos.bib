  Abstract                 = {Transport and mixing properties of surface currents can be detected from altimetric data by both Eulerian and Lagrangian diagnostics. In contrast with Eulerian diagnostics, Lagrangian tools like the local Lyapunov exponents have the advantage of exploiting both spatial and temporal variability of the velocity field and are in principle able to unveil subgrid filaments generated by chaotic stirring.}

  Abstract                 = {Numerical studies of the laser-{Lorenz} model using parameters reasonably accessible for recent experiments with a single mode homogeneously broadened laser demonstrate that the form of the return map of successive peak values of the intensity changes from a sharply cusped map in resonance to a map with a smoothly rounded maximum as the laser is detuned into the period doubling regime. This transformation appears to be related to the disappearance (with detuning) of the heteroclinic structural basis for the stable manifold which exists in resonance. This is in contrast to the evidence reported by Tang and Weiss (Phys. Rev. A 49 (1994) 1296) of a cusped map for both the period doubling chaos found with detuning and the spiral chaos found in resonance for seemingly Lorenz-like behavior of the far-infrared ammonia laser from which it was concluded that there existed a ?unique chaotic attractor for a single-mode laser?. }

  Abstract                 = {We develop and test two novel computational approaches for predicting the mean linear response of a chaotic dynamical system to small change in external forcing via the fluctuation-dissipation theorem. Unlike the earlier work in developing fluctuation-dissipation theorem-type computational strategies for chaotic nonlinear systems with forcing and dissipation, the new methods are based on the theory of Sinai-Ruelle-Bowen probability measures, which commonly describe the equilibrium state of such dynamical systems. The new methods take into account the fact that the dynamics of chaotic nonlinear forced-dissipative systems often reside on chaotic fractal attractors, where the classical quasi-Gaussian formula of the fluctuation-dissipation theorem often fails to produce satisfactory response prediction, especially in dynamical regimes with weak and moderate degrees of chaos. A simple new low-dimensional chaotic nonlinear forced-dissipative model is used to study the response of both linear and nonlinear functions to small external forcing in a range of dynamical regimes with an adjustable degree of chaos. We demonstrate that the two new methods are remarkably superior to the classical fluctuation-dissipation formula with quasi-Gaussian approximation in weakly and moderately chaotic dynamical regimes, for both linear and nonlinear response functions. One straightforward algorithm gives excellent results for short-time response while the other algorithm, based on systematic rational approximation, improves the intermediate and long time response predictions.},

  Abstract                 = {We present an approach to the design of feedback control laws that stabilize relative equilibria of general nonlinear systems with continuous symmetry. Using a template-based method, we factor out the dynamics associated with the symmetry variables and obtain evolution equations in a reduced frame that evolves in the symmetry direction. The relative equilibria of the original systems are fixed points of these reduced equations. Our controller design methodology is based on the linearization of the reduced equations about such fixed points. We present two different approaches of control design. The first approach assumes that the closed loop system is affine in the control and that the actuation is equivariant. We derive feedback laws for the reduced system that minimize a quadratic cost function. The second approach is more general; here the actuation need not be equivariant, but the actuators can be translated in the symmetry direction. The controller resulting from this approach leaves the dynamics associated with the symmetry variable unchanged. Both approaches are simple to implement, as they use standard tools available from linear control theory. We illustrate the approaches on three examples: a rotationally invariant planar {ODE,} an inverted pendulum on a cart, and the {Kuramoto-Sivashinsky} equation with periodic boundary conditions.}

We obtain an expression for the escape rate of the survival probability applying the theory of transient chaos. This expression improves previous estimates based on the properties of the closed system and explains dependencies on the position and size of the leak and on the initial ensemble. With a subtle choice of the initial ensemble, we obtain an equivalence to the classical problem of Poincare recurrences in closed systems, which is treated in the same framework. Finally, we show how our results apply to weakly chaotic systems and justify a split of the invariant saddle in hyperbolic and non-hyperbolic components, related, respectively, to the intermediate exponential and asymptotic power-law decays of the survival probability.},

In particular, we investigate how the drift for a parametrized family of normally hyperbolic relative equilibria can change character at what we call a `drift bifurcation'. To do this, we use results of Arnold to analyse parametrized families of elements in the Lie algebra of the symmetry group. We examine effects in physical space of such drift bifurcations for planar reaction-diffusion systems and note that these effects can explain certain aspects of the transition from rigidly rotating spirals to rigidly propagating `retracting waves'. This is a bifurcation observed in numerical simulations of excitable media where the rotation rate of a family of spirals slows down and gives way to a semi-infinite translating wavefront.}

  Abstract                 = {A rigorous proof is given in the standard map for the existence of chaotic trajectories with unbounded momenta for large enough coupling constant k. The obtained chaotic trajectories correspond to stationary configurations of the Frenkel-Kontorowa model with a finite (non-zero) photon gap (called gap parameter in dimensionless units). This property implies that the trajectory (or the configuration {ui}) can be uniquely continued as a uniformly continuous function of the model parameter k in some neighborhood of the initial configuration. A non-zero gap parameter implies that the Lyapunov coefficient is strictly positive (when it is defined). In addition, the existence of dilating and contracting manifolds is proven for these chaotic trajectories. ``Exotic''? trajectories such as ballistic trajectories are also proven to exist as a consequence of these theorems. The concept of anti-integrability emerges from these theorems. In the anti-integrable limit which can be only defined for a discrete time dynamical system, the coordinates of the trajectory at time i do not depend on the coordinates at time i - 1. Thus, at this singular limit, the existence of chaotic trajectories is trivial and the dynamical system reduces to a Bernoulli shift. It appears that the chaotic trajectories of dynamical systems originate by continuity from those which exists at the anti-integrable limits.},

We particularly focus here on the numerical resolution of these equations, which requires the additional concept of ?self-optimization? that we explain, and we describe the envelope code {BRAMA} that we used. As an application of our modeling, we present one-dimensional {BRAMA} simulations of stimulated Raman scattering which predict threshold intensities, as well as time scales for Raman growth above threshold, in very good agreement with those inferred from Vlasov simulations. Finally, we discuss the differences between our modeling and other published ones.},

By considering the ensemble average of an infinite series of regular functions and its iteration, we construct a transfer matrix, which is shown to be a trace class operator in a Hilbert space given that the positiveness of the random matrices is assumed. This fact gives a theoretical explanation of the superior convergence of the cycle expansion of the Lyapunov exponent (Bai 2007 J. Phys. A: Math. Theor. 40 8315). A numerical method based on the infinite transfer matrix is applied to a one-dimensional Ising model with a random field and a generalized Fibonacci sequence. It is found that, in the presence of continuous distribution of a disorder or degenerated random matrix, the transfer matrix approach is more efficient than the cycle expansion method.},

The exponential decay terms are automatically eliminated in the cycle expansion of the spectral determinant, which greatly accelerates the convergence provided all matrix elements are positive numbers. As a marginal case, the random Fibonacci series is studied in detail, and it is shown that this method is helpful.},

symmetric periodic orbits in Hamiltonian systems of two degrees of
freedom. The method is based on the classical search method but combining
up-to-date numerical algorithms in the search and in the integration
process. Instead of using Newton methods that requires to differentiate
the Poincar\' map we use the Brent?s method and in the integration process
a Taylor series method that permits us to compute the orbits using
extended precision, something highly interesting in the case of unstable
periodic orbits. These facts have permitted us to obtain many more
periodic orbits than other researchers. Once the families of periodic
orbits have been found we study the bifurcations just by comparing with
the stability index and the classical generic bifurcations for
Hamiltonian systems with and without symmetries. We illustrate the method
with four important classical Hamiltonian problems. },

to make a rigorous proof of the existence and the stability of families
of periodic orbits in two-degrees of freedom Hamiltonian systems, which
provide rigorous skeletons of periodic orbits. To that goal we show how
to prove the existence and stability of a huge set of discrete initial
conditions of periodic orbits, and later, how to prove the existence and
stability of continuous families of periodic orbits. We illustrate the
approach with two paradigmatic problems: the Hénon-Heiles Hamiltonian and

  Abstract                 = {The crossing of the narrow skin layer in solid targets by electrons in a time shorter than a laser cycle represents one of the numerous collisionless absorption mechanisms of intense laser-matter interaction. This kinetic effect is studied at normal and oblique laser beam incidence and particle injection by a test particle approach in an energy interval extending into the relativistic domain. Three main results obtained are the strong dependence of the energy gain by the single particle on the instant of injection relative to the phase of the light wave, the reflection of the particles primarily contributing to absorption well in front of the target rather than in the Debye layer, and the low degree of absorption hardly exceeding the 10\% limit. The simulation results offer a more unambiguous interpretation of the absorption mechanism often referred to as ?vacuum heating.? In particular, it is clearly revealed that the absorption in the vacuum region prevails on that originating from the skin layer. Relativistic ponderomotive effects are also tested, however their contribution to absorption is not significant.},

  Abstract                 = {The classical field theories that underlie the quantum
treatments of the electromagnetic, weak, and strong forces share a
peculiar feature: specifying the initial state of the field determines
the evolution of some degrees of freedom of the theory while leaving the
evolution of some others wholly arbitrary. This strongly suggests that
some of the variables of the standard state space lack physical
content?intuitively, the space of states of such a theory is of higher
dimension than the corresponding space of genuine physical possibilities.
The structure of such theories can helpfully be characterized in terms of
the action of symmetry groups on their space of states; and the
conceptual problems surrounding their strange behavior can be sharpened
in light of the observation that it is usually possible to eliminate the
redundant variables associated with these symmetries?which turn out to be
precisely those variables whose evolution is unconstrained by the
dynamical laws of the theory. This paper discusses this approach, uses it
to frame questions about the interpretation of classical gauge theories,
and to reflect (pessimistically) on our prospects of reaching
satisfactory answers to these questions. },

  Abstract                 = {A quantum Ising spin chain with nearest-neighbour couplings arranged in a quasiperiodic sequence is considered. The Cantor set structure of the energy spectrum is analysed in terms of the thermodynamic description of multifractals. Evidence is given that the spectrum of scales develops a singular behaviour: this is associated with a first-order phase transition of a new type. It is argued that this effect involves, not only quantum spins, but the whole class of phonon-like propagation problems on quasiperiodic chains.}

  Abstract                 = {Following the ideas of Howard and Kopell [9] a perturbation
theory is developed for slowly varying fully nonlinear wavetrains (i.e.
solutions which appear locally as travelling waves, but with frequencies
and wavelengths which may vary widely on long length and time scales).
This perturbation theory is applied to the Ginzburg-Landau equation. The
motion and stability of slowly varying wavetrains is shown to be governed
by a simple wave equation which can develop shocks corresponding to rapid
changes in wavenumber. Numerical results supporting this theory are
presented. A shock structure is proposed and numerically verified. These
results together with a winding invariant valid in the limit of slow
variation suggest that over a large range of parameters many initial
conditions relax to uniform wavetrains. The evolution of a marginally
diffusively stable wavetrain is also examined; it is argued that the
evolution is governed by a perturbed Korteweg-de Vries equation. },

This method yields the multipliers for conservation laws as well as an integral formula for corresponding conserved densities. The action of a symmetry (discrete or continuous) on a conservation law yields conservation laws. Conservation laws yield non-locally related systems that, in turn, can yield nonlocal symmetries and in addition be useful for the application of other mathematical methods. From symmetries or multipliers for conservation laws, one can determine whether or not a given system of differential equations can be linearized by an invertible transformation.}

  Abstract                 = {Today, light fields of controlled and measured waveform can be used to guide electron motion in atoms and molecules with attosecond precision. Here, we demonstrate attosecond control of collective electron motion in plasmas driven by extreme intensity (?1018 W cm?2) light fields. Controlled few-cycle near-infrared waves are tightly focused at the interface between vacuum and a solid-density plasma, where they launch and guide subcycle motion of electrons from the plasma with characteristic energies in the multi-kiloelectronvolt range?two orders of magnitude more than has been achieved so far in atoms and molecules. The basic spectroscopy of the coherent extreme ultraviolet radiation emerging from the light?plasma interaction allows us to probe this collective motion of charge with sub-200 as resolution. This is an important step towards attosecond control of charge dynamics in laser-driven plasma experiments.},

  Abstract                 = {A fundamental class of solutions of symmetric Hamiltonian systems is relative equilibria. In this paper the nonlinear problem near a degenerate relative equilibrium is considered. The degeneracy creates a saddle-center and attendant homoclinic bifurcation in the reduced system transverse to the group orbit. The surprising result is that the curvature of the pullback of the momentum map to the Lie algebra determines the normal form for the homoclinic bifurcation. There is also an induced directional geometric phase in the homoclinic bifurcation. The backbone of the analysis is the use of singularity theory for smooth mappings between manifolds applied to the pullback of the momentum map. The theory is constructive and generalities are given for symmetric Hamiltonian systems on a vector space of dimension (2n+2) with an n-dimensional abelian symmetry group. Examples for n=1,2,3 are presented to illustrate application of the theory.}

  Abstract                 = {The method we present in this paper uses trajectory averages of scalar functions on the state space to: (a) identify invariant sets in the state space, and (b) to form coherent structures by aggregating invariant sets that are similar across multiple spatial scales. First, we construct the ergodic quotient, the object obtained by mapping trajectories to the space of the trajectory averages of a function basis on the state space. Second, we endow the ergodic quotient with a metric structure that successfully captures how similar the invariant sets are in the state space. Finally, we parametrize the ergodic quotient using intrinsic diffusion modes on it. By segmenting the ergodic quotient based on the diffusion modes, we extract coherent features in the state space of the dynamical system. The algorithm is validated by analyzing the Arnold-Beltrami-Childress flow, which was the test-bed for alternative approaches: the Ulam's approximation of the transfer operator and the computation of Lagrangian Coherent Structures. Furthermore, we explain how the method extends the Poincar\'e map analysis for periodic flows. As a demonstration, we apply the method to a periodically-driven three-dimensional Hill's vortex flow, discovering unknown coherent structures in its state space.},

  Abstract                 = { The chaotic dynamics of Alfv\'en waves in space plasmas governed by the derivative nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation, in the low-dimensional limit described by stationary spatial solutions, is studied. A bifurcation diagram is constructed, by varying the driver amplitude, to identify a number of nonlinear dynamical processes including saddle-node bifurcation, boundary crisis, and interior crisis. The roles played by unstable periodic orbits and chaotic saddles in these transitions are analyzed, and the conversion from a chaotic saddle to a chaotic attractor in these dynamical processes is demonstrated. In particular, the phenomenon of gap-filling in the chaotic transition from weak chaos to strong chaos via an interior crisis is investigated. A coupling unstable periodic orbit created by an explosion, within the gaps of the chaotic saddles embedded in a chaotic attractor following an interior crisis, is found numerically. The gap-filling unstable periodic orbits are responsible for coupling the banded chaotic saddle (BCS) to the surrounding chaotic saddle (SCS), leading to crisis-induced intermittency. The physical relevance of chaos for Alfv\'en intermittent turbulence observed in the solar wind is discussed. },

On a fixed mesh, we construct closed curves that converge smoothly to periodic orbits as the degree of the Taylor series expansions increase. The algorithms have been implemented in Matlab together with the use of the automatic differentiation code ADOL-C. Numerical tests of our codes are compared with AUTO calculations using the Hodgkin-Huxley equations as a test problem.},

We do this by introducing a stability parameter and augmenting the dynamical system with an orthonormal k-dimensional frame and a Lyapunov vector such that the frame is continuously Gram-Schmidt orthonormalized and at most linear growth of the dynamical variables is involved. We prove that the method is strongly stable when where is the kth Lyapunov exponent in descending order and we show through examples how the method is implemented. }

Similarities with longitudinal vortices recently observed in experiments are discussed.}

  Abstract                 = {Abstract Lyapunov vectors have found growing interest recently due to their ability to characterize systems out of thermodynamic equilibrium. The computation of orthogonal Gram-Schmidt vectors requires multiplication and \{QR\} decomposition of large matrices, which grow as N 2 (with the particle count). This expense has limited such calculations to relatively small systems and short time scales. Here, we detail two implementations of an algorithm for computing Gram-Schmidt vectors. The first is a distributed-memory message-passing method using Scalapack. The second uses the newly-released \{MAGMA\} library for GPUs. We compare the performance of both codes for Lennard-Jones fluids from N = 100 to 1300 between Intel Nahalem/Infiniband \{DDR\} and \{NVIDIA\} \{C2050\} architectures. To our best knowledge, these are the largest systems for which the Gram-Schmidt Lyapunov vectors have been computed, and the first time their calculation has been GPU-accelerated. We conclude that Lyapunov vector calculations can be significantly extended in length and time by leveraging the power of GPU-accelerated linear algebra.},

A paradigmatic example is the fractal diffusion coefficient arising in a simple piecewise linear one-dimensional map of the real line.

As an example, we explicitly derive the exact size- and position-dependent escape rate in a Markov case for holes of finite-size. Moreover, a general relation between the transfer operators of the closed and corresponding open systems, together with the generating function of the probability of return to the hole is derived. This relation is then used to compute the small hole asymptotic behavior, in terms of readily calculable quantities. As an example we derive logarithmic corrections in the second order term. Being valid for Markov systems, our framework can find application in many areas of the physical sciences such as information theory, network theory, quantum Weyl law and, via Ulam's method, can be used as an approximation method in general dynamical systems.},

The intermittency of this billiard is utilized so that the zeta functions may be approximately expressed in terms of the probability distribution of laminar lengths. In particular we study a one-parameter family of weights. Depending on the parameter the trace can be dominated by branch cuts in the zeta function or by isolated zeros. In the former case the time dependence of the trace is dominated by a power law and in the latter case by an exponential. A phase transition occurs when the leading zero collides with a branch cut. The family considered is relevant for the calculation of resonance spectra, semiclassical spectra and topological entropy.},

  Abstract                 = {We consider the computation of the eigenvalues of the evolution operator-the resonance spectrum-by means of the zeros of a zeta function. In particular we address the problems of applying this formalism to bound chaotic systems, caused by e.g. intermittency and non-completeness of the symbolic dynamics. For bound intermittent systems we derive an approximation of the zeta function. With the aid of this zeta function it is argued that bound systems with long time tails have branch cuts in the zeta function and traces (of the evolution operator) approaching unity as a power law. We also show that the dominant time scale can be much longer than the period of the shortest periodic orbit, as is, for example, the case for the hyperbola billiard. Isolated zeros of the zeta function for the hyperbola billiard are evaluated by means of a cycle expansion. Crucial for the success of this approach is the identification of a sequence of periodic orbit responsible for a logarithmic branch cut in the zeta function. Semiclassical implications are briefly discussed.},

We reanalyze the ones that were previously described via a {4D} reduction to the center-unstable manifold {(Ambruster} et al., 1988, 1989). We also find a parameter region for which a manifold of structurally stable heteroclinic cycles exist. The existence of such a manifold is responsible for an intermittent behavior which has some features of unpredictability.},

The computations include detection of bifurcations and corresponding branch switching. A simple example is used to illustrate the main idea. Thereafter we compute families of periodic solutions of the circular restricted 3-body problem. We also continue the figure-8 orbit recently discovered by Chenciner and Montgomery, and numerically computed by Simu'o, as the mass of one of the bodies is allowed to vary. In particular, we show how the invariances (phase-shift, scaling law, and x, y, z translations and rotations) can be dealt with. Our numerical results show, among other things, that there exists a continuous path of periodic solutions from the figure-8 orbit to a periodic solution of the restricted 3-body problem.}

  Abstract                 = {A systematic study of spatially periodic steady solutions of
the Kuramoto?Sivashinsky equation (KSe) is undertaken from a dynamical
systems? point of view. A recently devised variational method is employed
and one new variant is developed. At fixed system size L = 43.5 ,
important equilibria are identified and shown to organize the dynamics.
The first integral of the steady \{KSe\} leads to a 3D dynamical system
with an integration constant c. At a typical value of c = 0.40194 , four
simplest cycles are identified and used as basic building blocks to
construct longer cycles. The symbolic dynamics based on trajectory
topology are very effective in classifying all short periodic orbits. The
probation of the return map on a chosen Poincar\'e section shows the
complexity of the dynamics and the bifurcation of building blocks
provides a chart to look for possible cycles at given periods. The
current study may be conveniently adapted to the identification and
classification of cycles in other nonlinear systems. },

We observe spectra with the characteristic spectral signature of {CSE?a} slow decay of intensity, I, with high-harmonic order, n, as I(n) n?1.62 before a rapid efficiency rollover. Particle-in-cell code simulations reveal how dense nanobunches of electrons are periodically formed and accelerated during normal-incidence interactions with ultrathin foils and result in {CSE} in the transmitted direction. This observation of {CSE} presents a route to high-energy {XUV} pulses and offers a new window on understanding ultrafast energy coupling during intense laser?solid density interactions.},

continuous symmetries. For general maps, in contrast to the symplectic
case, the existence of a symmetry no longer implies the existence of an
invariant. Conversely, a map with an invariant need not have a symmetry.
We show that when a symmetry flow has a global Poincaré section there are
coordinates in which the map takes a reduced, skew-product form, and
hence allows for reduction of dimensionality. We show that the reduction
of a volume-preserving map again is volume preserving. Finally we sharpen
the Noether theorem for symplectic maps. A number of illustrative
examples are discussed and the method is compared with traditional
reduction techniques.},

  Abstract                 = {The Lagrange-Poincare equations of classical mechanics are cast into a field theoretic context together with their associated constrained variational principle. An integrability / reconstruction condition is established that relates solutions of the original problem with those of the reduced problem. The Kelvin-Noether theorem is formulated in this context. Applications to the isoperimetric problem, the Skyrme model for meson interaction, metamorphosis image dynamics, and molecular strands illustrate various aspects of the theory.}

The properties of linear and nonlinear plasma waves are discussed, as well as electron acceleration in plasma waves. Methods for injecting and trapping plasma electrons in plasma waves are also discussed. Limits to the electron energy gain are summarized, including laser pulse diffraction, electron dephasing, laser pulse energy depletion, and beam loading limitations. The basic physics of laser pulse evolution in underdense plasmas is also reviewed. This includes the propagation, self-focusing, and guiding of laser pulses in uniform plasmas and with preformed density channels. Instabilities relevant to intense short-pulse laser-plasma interactions, such as Raman, self-modulation, and hose instabilities, are discussed. Experiments demonstrating key physics, such as the production of high-quality electron bunches at energies of 0.1 {GeV}, are summarized.},

  Abstract                 = {A traditional subject in statistical physics is the linear response of a molecular dynamical system to changes in an external forcing agency, e.g. the Ohmic response of an electrical conductor to an applied electric field. For molecular systems the linear response matrices, such as the electrical conductivity, can be represented by Green-Kubo formulae as improper time-integrals of 2-time correlation functions in the system. Recently, Ruelle has extended the Green-Kubo formalism to describe the statistical, steady-state response of a 'sufficiently chaotic' nonlinear dynamical system to changes in its parameters. This formalism potentially has a number of important applications. For instance, in studies of global warming one wants to calculate the response of climate-mean temperature to a change in the atmospheric concentration of greenhouse gases. In general, a climate sensitivity is defined as the linear response of a long-time average to changes in external forces. We show that Ruelle's linear response formula can be computed by an ensemble adjoint technique and that this algorithm is equivalent to a more standard ensemble adjoint method proposed by Lea, Allen and Haine to calculate climate sensitivities. In a numerical implementation for the 3-variable, chaotic Lorenz model it is shown that the two methods perform very similarly. However, because of a power-law tail in the histogram of adjoint gradients their sum over ensemble members becomes a L?vy flight , and the central limit theorem breaks down. The law of large numbers still holds and the ensemble-average converges to the desired sensitivity, but only very slowly, as the number of samples is increased. We discuss the implications of this example more generally for ensemble adjoint techniques and for the important practical issue of calculating climate sensitivities.},

  Abstract                 = {Prequantum dynamics was introduced in the 70s by
Kostant, Souriau and Kirillov as an intermediate between
classical and quantum dynamics. In common with the classical
dynamics, prequantum dynamics transports functions on phase
space, but adds some phases which are important in quantum
interference effects. In the case of hyperbolic dynamical
systems, it is believed that the study of the prequantum
dynamics will give a better understanding of the quantum
interference effects for large time, and of their statistical
properties. We consider a linear hyperbolic map which generates
a chaotic dynamical system on
the torus. The dynamics is lifted to a prequantum fiber bundle.
This gives a unitary prequantum (partially hyperbolic) map. We
calculate its resonances and show that they are related to the
quantum eigenvalues. A remarkable consequence is that quantum
dynamics emerges from long-term behavior of prequantum
dynamics. We present trace formulas, and discuss perspectives
of this approach in the nonlinear case.},

  Abstract                 = {Particle accelerators are used in a wide variety of fields, ranging from medicine and biology to high-energy physics. The accelerating fields in conventional accelerators are limited to a few tens of {MeV} m-1, owing to material breakdown at the walls of the structure. Thus, the production of energetic particle beams currently requires large-scale accelerators and expensive infrastructures. Laser?plasma accelerators have been proposed as a next generation of compact accelerators because of the huge electric fields they can sustain ({\textgreater}100 {GeV} m-1). However, it has been difficult to use them efficiently for applications because they have produced poor-quality particle beams with large energy spreads, owing to a randomization of electrons in phase space. Here we demonstrate that this randomization can be suppressed and that the quality of the electron beams can be dramatically enhanced. Within a length of 3 mm, the laser drives a plasma bubble that traps and accelerates plasma electrons. The resulting electron beam is extremely collimated and quasi-monoenergetic, with a high charge of 0.5 {nC} at 170 {MeV.}},

  Abstract                 = {{This work comprises a general study of
 symmetry breaking for compact Lie groups in the context of equivariant
 bifurcation theory. We start by extending the theory developed by Field
 and Richardson {[}37] for absolutely irreducible representations of
 finite groups to general irreducible representations of compact Lie
 groups. In particular, we allow for branches of relative equilibria and
 phenomena such as the Hopf bifurcation. We also present a general
 theory of determinacy for irreducible Lie group actions along the lines
 previously described in Field {[}29]. In the main result of this work,
 we show that branching patterns for generic equivariant bifurcation
 problems defined on irreducible representations persist under
 perturbations by sufficiently high order non-equivariant terms. We give
 applications of this result to normal form computations yielding, for
 example, equivariant Hopf bifurcations and show how normal form
 computations of branching and stabilities are valid when we take
 account of the non-normalized tail.}}

Growth of the variance of a distribution of tracers is divided into transient and long-term regimes, each with different growth exponents.}

In particular, we stress the importance of accounting for both the nonlinear frequency shift of the electron plasma wave and the growth of sidebands, in order to understand what stops the coherent growth of Raman scattering. Using a Bernstein-Greene-Kruskal approach, we provide an estimate for the maximum amplitude reached by a {BSRS-driven} plasma wave after the phase of monotonic growth. This estimate is in very good agreement with the results from kinetic simulations of stimulated Raman scattering using both a Vlasov and a Particle in Cell code. Our analysis, which may be generalized to a multidimensional geometry, should provide a means to estimate the limits of backward Raman amplification or the effectiveness of strategies that aim at strongly reducing Raman reflectivity in a fusion plasma.},

  Abstract                 = {... detecting UPOs of nonlinear map is one of the most challenging problems of nonlinear science in both numerical computations and experimental measures. In this paper, a new method is proposed to detect the UPOs in a non-Lyapunov way. Firstly three special techniques are added to quantum-behaved particle swarm optimization (QPSO), a novel mbest particle, contracting the searching space self-adaptively and boundaries restriction (NCB), then the new method NCB--QPSO is proposed. It can maintain an effective search mechanism with fine equilibrium between exploitation and exploration. Secondly, the problems of detecting the UPOs are converted into a non-negative functions' minimization through a proper translation in a non-Lyapunov way. Thirdly the simulations to 6 benchmark optimization problems and different high order UPOs of 5 classic nonlinear maps are done by the proposed method. And the results show that NCB--QPSO is a successful method in detecting the UPOs, and it has the advantages of fast convergence, high precision and robustness.},

  Abstract                 = {Laser-driven accelerators, in which particles are accelerated by the electric field of a plasma wave (the wakefield) driven by an intense laser, have demonstrated accelerating electric fields of hundreds of {GV} m-1 (refs 1?3). These fields are thousands of times greater than those achievable in conventional radio-frequency accelerators, spurring interest in laser accelerators as compact next-generation sources of energetic electrons and radiation. To date, however, acceleration distances have been severely limited by the lack of a controllable method for extending the propagation distance of the focused laser pulse. The ensuing short acceleration distance results in low-energy beams with 100 per cent electron energy spread, which limits potential applications. Here we demonstrate a laser accelerator that produces electron beams with an energy spread of a few per cent, low emittance and increased energy (more than 109 electrons above 80 {MeV).} Our technique involves the use of a preformed plasma density channel to guide a relativistically intense laser, resulting in a longer propagation distance. The results open the way for compact and tunable high-brightness sources of electrons and radiation.},

neighboring particles occur through hard core elastic

billiards. We consider the case where the collisions are rare

the evolution of the probability densities. We solve this
equation in the linear regime and compute the heat conductivity
in the approximate stationary state and with the help of the
Green-Kubo formula. We demonstrate the validity of the
molecular chaos hypothesis by comparing our theoretical
predictions to the results of numerical simulations performed
on a new class of models, which are defocusing chaotic
billiards, likened to higher-dimensional stadia.},

  Abstract                 = {We investigate experimentally the mixing dynamics in a channel flow with a finite stirring region undergoing chaotic advection. We study the homogenization of dye in two variants of an eggbeater stirring protocol that differ in the extent of their mixing region. In the first case, the mixing region is separated from the side walls of the channel, while in the second it extends to the walls. For the first case, we observe the onset of a permanent concentration pattern that repeats over time with decaying intensity. A quantitative analysis of the concentration field of dye confirms the convergence to a self-similar pattern, akin to the strange eigenmodes previously observed in closed flows. We model this phenomenon using an idealized map, where an analysis of the mixing dynamics explains the convergence to an eigenmode. In contrast, for the second case the presence of no-slip walls and separation points on the frontier of the mixing region leads to non-self-similar mixing dynamics.}

In this paper we pursue the idea that the infinite number of unstable periodic orbits embedded in the support of the measure provides the key to an understanding of the structure of the subsets with different singularity scalings. In particular, a formulation relating the spectrum of dimensions to unstable periodic orbits is presented for hyperbolic maps of arbitrary dimensionality. Both chaotic attractors and chaotic repellers are considered.},

  Abstract                 = {The theory of chaotic dynamical systems gives many tools that can be used in climate studies. The widely used ones are the Lyapunov exponents, the Kolmogorov entropy and the attractor dimension characterizing global quantities of a system. Another potentially useful tool from dynamical system theory arises from the fact that the local analysis of a system probability distribution function (PDF) can be accomplished by using a procedure that involves an expansion in terms of unstable periodic orbits (UPOs). The system measure (or its statistical characteristics) is approximated as a weighted sum over the orbits. The weights are inversely proportional to the orbit instability characteristics so that the least unstable orbits make larger contributions to the PDF. Consequently, one can expect some relationship between the least unstable orbits and the local maxima of the system PDF. As a result, the most probable system trajectories (or `circulation regimes' in some sense) may be explained in terms of orbits. For the special classes of chaotic dynamical systems, there is a strict theory guaranteeing the accuracy of this approach. However, a typical atmospheric model may not qualify for these theorems. In our study, we will try to apply the idea of UPO expansion to the simple atmospheric system based on the barotropic vorticity equation of the sphere. We will check how well orbits approximate the system attractor, its statistical characteristics and PDF. The connection of the most probable states of the system with the least unstable periodic orbits will also be analysed.},

In particular, we have studied the nature of ``25 day'' mode of variability (Branstator, 1987; Kushnir 1987). This mode arises as a first complex empirical orthogonal function (or ``Hilbert EOF'' according to (H. von Storch, Zwiers)) for a given system and is a dominant rotational component of the system dynamics. It was shown that the mode structure coincides with several least unstable periodic orbits of the system. The phase portrait of the system in the plane of the first complex EOF has regular shape with maximum of the probability density function in the vicinity of these weakly unstable periodic orbits.},

  Abstract                 = {Unstable periodic trajectories of a chaotic dissipative system belong to the attractor of the system and are its important characteristics. Many chaotic systems have an infinite number of periodic solutions forming the skeleton of the system attractor. This allows one to approximate the system trajectories and statistical characteristics by using periodic solutions. The least unstable orbits may generate local maxima of the system state distribution functions on the attractor. With respect to atmospheric systems this means that orbits may determine dynamic circulation regimes and typical variability modes of the system. In some cases, given a small number of periodic solutions, one can describe the dynamics on the attractor of the system and the basic statistics with sufficient precision. Thus, the information concerning periodic trajectories of a particular dynamic system may be very important for analysis of its behavior. A search for periodic trajectories is reduced to the solution of a system of nonlinear equations with respect to the initial condition of an orbit and its period. The choice of a numerical solution method and an initial guess is an important aspect here. In this paper we consider the problem of the calculation of periodic trajectories for a barotropic model of the atmosphere. Several methods for determination of periodic orbits of the model are formulated and implemented, including the Newton method with step suppression, the Newton method with a second order tensor correction, the quasi-Newton method with step suppression, the quasi-Newton method with minimization of the error functional and approximate Hessian inversion by the LBFG scheme and the GMRES method. A comparison of the efficiency of these numerical methods and different choices of initial conditions is performed. Various factors influencing the rate of convergence of the methods are considered.},

Here, a mathematically rigorous justification of linear response theory for forced dissipative stochastic dynamical systems is developed. The main results are formulated in an abstract setting and apply to suitable systems, in finite and infinite dimensions, that are of interest in climate change science and other applications.}

The boundaries are defined as material lines that are linearly stable or unstable for longer times than any of their neighbors. Such material lines are responsible for stretching and folding in the mixing of passive tracers. We derive an analytic criterion that can be used to extract coherent structures with high precision from numerical or experimental data sets. The criterion provides a rigorous link between the Lagrangian concept of hyperbolicity, the {Okubo?Weiss} criterion, and vortex boundaries. We apply the results to simulations of two-dimensional barotropic turbulence.},

  Abstract                 = {Transition to turbulence in pipe flow is one of the most fundamental and longest-standing problems in fluid dynamics. Stability theory suggests that the flow remains laminar for all flow rates, but in practice pipe flow becomes turbulent even at moderate speeds. This transition drastically affects the transport efficiency of mass, momentum, and heat. On the basis of the recent discovery of unstable traveling waves in computational studies of the Navier-Stokes equations and ideas from dynamical systems theory, a model for the transition process has been suggested. We report experimental observation of these traveling waves in pipe flow, confirming the proposed transition scenario and suggesting that the dynamics associated with these unstable states may indeed capture the nature of fluid turbulence.}

 systems. In this method, the Ritz space for the domain is constructed by
 numerical evaluation of a contour integral. The effect of the numerical
 approximation is analyzed from the viewpoint of a filter operator, which
 supports the use of moderate approximations. The numerical accuracy of
 the original moment-based approach is also assured. A block version of
 the CIRR method is proposed with a detailed algorithm, which allows us
 to resolve degenerated systems.}},

(2007). As the Reynolds number is increased, chaotic Kolmogorov flows become non-hyperbolic at a certain Reynolds number, where some new physical property is expected to appear in the long-time statistics of the fluid motion. Here we focus our attention on behaviors of the time-correlation function of vorticity across the transition point, and that the long-time asymptotic form of the correlation function changes at the Reynolds number close to that of the hyperbolic/non-hyperbolic transition, which suggests that the time-correlation function reflects the transition to non-hyperbolicity.},

Using this result, we show that topological properties of the dynamics of the Lozi mapping are determined by its pruning front and primary pruned region only. This gives us a solution to the first tangency problem for the Lozi family, moreover the boundary of the set of all horseshoes in the parameter space is shown to be algebraic.},

  Abstract                 = {A general study of the effects of noise interacting with the deterministic dynamics of nonhyperbolic chaotic 2-D maps and 3-flows is presented. Noise in these systems can have dramatic effects on the invariant measure of the system. In regions of homoclinic tangencies perturbations are transported away from the neighborhood of the attractor, leading to deformations which can be one to two orders of magnitude larger than the noise level. A qualitative understanding is attained by a study of the universal properties of the unstable and stable foliation of the phase space in the vicinity of homoclinic tangencies. Through the investigation of nontrivial structures of the tangent space at homoclinic tangencies related to the non-normal Jacobians we obtain a quantitative description of these noise-induced deformations of the attractor. Local expansion rates which are much larger than the maximal Lyapunov exponent can be used as a measure of the system's structural instability under perturbations. We exemplify our general results on the {H\'enon}, Ikeda and Duffing system. A new and effective algorithm to calculate the homoclinic tangencies in the entire phase space based on the results of this paper is presented.},

  Abstract                 = {Temporal integration of equations possessing continuous symmetries (e.g. systems with translational invariance associated with traveling solutions and scale invariance associated with self-similar solutions) in a "co-evolving" frame (i.e. a frame which is co-traveling, co-collapsing or co-exploding with the evolving solution) leads to improved accuracy because of the smaller time derivative in the new spatial frame. The slower time behavior permits the use of projective and coarse projective integration with longer projective steps in the computation of the time evolution of partial differential equations and multiscale systems, respectively. These methods are also demonstrated to be effective for systems which only approximately or asymptotically possess continuous symmetries. The ideas of projective integration in a co-evolving frame are illustrated on the one-dimensional, translationally invariant Nagumo partial differential equation {(PDE).} A corresponding kinetic Monte Carlo model, motivated from the Nagumo kinetics, is used to illustrate the coarse-grained method. A simple, one-dimensional diffusion problem is used to illustrate the scale invariant case. The efficiency of projective integration in the co-evolving frame for both the macroscopic diffusion {PDE} and for a random-walker particle based model is again demonstrated.},

This method allows us to determine the forcing perturbation which maximizes the norm of the perturbation of a statistical moment of the solution on the attractor. The method was applied to the Lorenz model. The estimates of perturbations of two statistical moments were compared with directly calculated values. The comparison shows that some 100 UPOs are sufficient to realize this approach and get a good accuracy. The linear approach remains valid up to rather high norms of the forcing perturbation.},

  Abstract                 = {The problem of understanding the nature of fluid flow through a circular straight pipe remains one of the oldest problems in fluid mechanics. So far no explanation has been substantiated to rationalize the transition process by which the steady unidirectional laminar flow state gives way to a temporally and spatially disordered three-dimensional (turbulent) solution as the flow rate increases. Recently, new travelling wave solutions have been discovered which are saddle points in phase space. These plausibly represent the lowest level in a hierarchy of spatio-temporal periodic flow solutions which may be used to construct a cycle expansion theory of turbulent pipe flows. We summarize this success against the backdrop of past work and discuss its implications for future research.}

Evidence for recurrent travelling wave visits is found in both 5D and 10D long periodic pipes but only for those travelling waves with low-to-intermediate wall shear stress and for less than about 10\%\ of the time in turbulent flow. Dynamical structures such as periodic orbits need to be isolated and included in any such expansion.}

  Abstract                 = {We propose the {Karhunen-Lo\'eve} {(K-L)} decomposition as a tool to analyze complex spatio-temporal structures in {PDE} simulations in terms of concepts from dynamical systems theory. Taking the {Kuramoto-Sivashinsky} equation as a model problem we discuss the {K-L} decomposition for 4 different values of its bifurcation parameter a. We distinguish two modes of using the {K-L} decomposition: As an analytic and synthetic tool respectively. Using the analytic mode we find unstable fixed points and stable and unstable manifolds in a parameter regime with structurally stable homoclinic orbits (a=17.75). Choosing the data for a {K-L} analysis carefully by restricting them to certain burst events, we can analyze a more complicated intermittent regime at a=68. We establish that the spatially localized oscillations around a so called `strange' fixed point which are considered as fore-runners of spatially concentrated zones of turbulence are in fact created by a very specific limit cycle (a=83.75) which, for a=87, bifurcates into a modulated traveling wave. Using the {K-L} decomposition synthetically by determining an optimal Galerkin system, we present evidence that the {K-L} decomposition systematically destroys dissipation and leads to blow up solutions.}

Periodic orbits are classfied according to the rotation number, symmetry, and morse index. Unstable orbits repel other periodic orbits to form resonances where a orbit can be trapped for long with the same rotation number. The chain of resonances with the same commensurability forms channel which provides the communication bridge between different resonances. The connection of the orbit structure with the continued fraction representation of real numbers is discussed.}

The origins of cosmic rays are long standing open issues in astrophysics.

However, the acceleration and transport processes of the cosmic rays are not well understood, and how the collisionless shocks are created is still under investigation. Recent high-power and high-intensity laser technologies allow us to simulate astrophysical phenomena in laboratories. We present our experimental results of collisionless shock formations in laser-produced plasmas.},

Each of them corresponds to a saddle solution of the two-dimensional generalization of Feigenbaum-Cvitanovic equation and is characterized by a set of distinct universal constants analogous to Feigenbaum's alpha; and delta;. We present a number of examples (driven self-oscillators, coupled Henon-like maps, coupled driven oscillators, coupled chaotic self-oscillators), which manifest these types of behavior.},

  Abstract                 = {We present a derivation, a physical explanation and applications of cycle expansions in different dynamical systems, ranging from simple one-dimensional maps to turbulence in fluids. Cycle expansion is a newly devised powerful tool for computing averages of physical observables in nonlinear chaotic systems which combines many innovative ideas developed in dynamical systems, such as hyperbolicity, invariant manifolds, symbolic dynamics, measure theory and thermodynamic formalism. The concept of cycle expansion has a deep root in theoretical physics, bearing a close analogy to cumulant expansion in statistical physics and effective action functional in quantum field theory, the essence of which is to represent a physical system in a hierarchical way by utilizing certain multiplicative structures such that the dominant parts of physical observables are captured by compact, maneuverable objects while minor detailed variations are described by objects with a larger space and time scale. The technique has been successfully applied to many low-dimensional dynamical systems and much effort has recently been made to extend its use to spatially extended systems. For one-dimensional systems such as the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation, the method turns out to be very effective while for more complex real-world systems including the Navier-Stokes equation, the method is only starting to yield its first fruits and much more work is needed to enable practical computations. However, the experience and knowledge accumulated so far is already very useful to a large set of research problems. Several such applications are briefly described in what follows. As more research effort is devoted to the study of complex dynamics of nonlinear systems, cycle expansion will undergo a fast development and find wide applications.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper addresses some fundamental methodological issues concerning the sensitivity analysis of chaotic geophysical systems. We show, using the Lorenz system as an example, that a naive approach to variational (``adjoint'') sensitivity analysis is of limited utility. Applied to trajectories which are long relative to the predictability time scales of the system, cumulative error growth means that adjoint results diverge exponentially from the ``macroscopic climate sensitivity''(that is, the sensitivity of time-averaged properties of the system to finite-amplitude perturbations). This problem occurs even for time-averaged quantities and given infinite computing resources. Alternatively, applied to very short trajectories, the adjoint provides an incorrect estimate of the sensitivity, even if averaged over large numbers of initial conditions, because a finite time scale is required for the model climate to respond fully to certain perturbations. In the Lorenz (1963) system, an intermediate time scale is found on which an ensemble of adjoint gradients can give a reasonably accurate (O(10%)) estimate of the macroscopic climate sensitivity. While this ensemble-adjoint approach is unlikely to be reliable for more complex systems, it may provide useful guidance in identifying important parameter-combinations to be explored further through direct finite-amplitude perturbations.},

The algorithms for computation of the time averages of many L1 functions are developed and employed producing the approximation of the phase space ergodic partitioning. The method is exposed in the context of discrete-time dynamical systems producing a graphical representation of the phase space in terms of the invariant set structure that gives a substantial insight into the global and local properties of the dynamics. We use the Chirikov standard map in order to show the implementation of the method, followed by applications to other multi-dimensional maps. We examine the visualization of periodic sets using harmonic time averages.}

The model includes the nonlinear interactions among disturbances of three different wave lengths. Nonperiodic time-dependent solutions are determined by numerical integration.By comparing separate solutions with slightly different initial conditions, the growth rate of small initial errors is studied. The time required for errors comparable to observational errors in the atmosphere to grow to intolerable errors is strongly dependent upon the current circulation pattern, and varies from a few days to a few weeks.Some statistical predictability of certain quantities seems to be present even after errors in the complete circulation pattern are no longer small. The feasibility of performing similar studies with much larger atmospheric models is considered.},

An overview is given of the state of the art of ion acceleration by laser pulses as well as an outlook on its future development and perspectives.

  Abstract                 = {High-power lasers that fit into a university-scale laboratory can now reach focused intensities of more than 1019 W cm-2 at high repetition rates. Such lasers are capable of producing beams of energetic electrons, protons and -rays. Relativistic electrons are generated through the breaking of large-amplitude relativistic plasma waves created in the wake of the laser pulse as it propagates through a plasma, or through a direct interaction between the laser field and the electrons in the plasma. However, the electron beams produced from previous laser?plasma experiments have a large energy spread, limiting their use for potential applications. Here we report high-resolution energy measurements of the electron beams produced from intense laser?plasma interactions, showing that?under particular plasma conditions?it is possible to generate beams of relativistic electrons with low divergence and a small energy spread (less than three per cent). The monoenergetic features were observed in the electron energy spectrum for plasma densities just above a threshold required for breaking of the plasma wave. These features were observed consistently in the electron spectrum, although the energy of the beam was observed to vary from shot to shot. If the issue of energy reproducibility can be addressed, it should be possible to generate ultrashort monoenergetic electron bunches of tunable energy, holding great promise for the future development of 'table-top' particle accelerators.},

higher-order bright solitons in nonlinear nonlocal media have been
frequently observed numerically in recent years, however, the origin of
these phenomena was never completely elucidated. In this paper, we
perform a linear stability analysis of these higher-order solitons by
solving the Bogoliubov-de Gennes equations. This enables us to understand
the emergence of a new oscillatory state as a growing unstable mode of a
higher-order soliton. Using dynamically important states as a basis, we
provide low-dimensional visualizations of the dynamics and identify
quasiperiodic and homoclinic orbits, linking the latter to
shape-transformations.},

We study numerical integrators which also preserve the foliation. The case in which the foliation is given by the orbits of an action of a Lie group has a particularly nice structure, which we study in detail, giving conditions under which all foliate vector fields can be written as the sum of a vector field tangent to the orbits and a vector field invariant under the group action. This allows the application of many techniques of geometric integration, including splitting methods and Lie group integrators.},

  Abstract                 = {The purpose of this paper is to develop analytical methods for studyingparticle paths in a class of three-dimensional incompressible fluid flows. In this paper we study three-dimensionalvolume preserving vector fields that are invariant under the action of a one-parameter symmetry group whose infinitesimal generator is autonomous and volume-preserving. We show that there exists a coordinate system in which the vector field assumes a simple form. In particular, the evolution of two of the coordinates is governed by a time-dependent, one-degree-of-freedom Hamiltonian system with the evolution of the remaining coordinate being governed by a first-order differential equation that depends only on the other two coordinates and time. The new coordinates depend only on the symmetry group of the vector field. Therefore they arefield-independent. The coordinate transformation is constructive. If the vector field is time-independent, then it possesses an integral of motion. Moreover, we show that the system can be further reduced toaction-angle-angle coordinates. These are analogous to the familiar action-angle variables from Hamiltonian mechanics and are quite useful for perturbative studies of the class of systems we consider. In fact, we show how our coordinate transformation puts us in a position to apply recent extensions of the {Kolmogorov-Arnold-Moser} {(KAM)} theorem for three-dimensional, volume-preserving maps as well as three-dimensional versions of Melnikov's method. We discuss the integrability of the class of flows considered, and draw an analogy with Clebsch variables in fluid mechanics.}

Hair cells are cells in the inner ear responsible for translating sound-induced mechanical stimuli into an electrical signal that can then be recorded by the auditory nerve. In nonmammals, two separate mechanisms have been postulated to contribute to the amplification and tuning properties of the hair cells. Models of each of these mechanisms have been shown to be poised near a Hopf bifurcation. Through a weakly nonlinear analysis that assumes weak periodic forcing, weak damping, and weak coupling, the physiologically based models of the two mechanisms are reduced to a system of two coupled amplitude equations describing the resonant response. The predictions that follow from an analysis of the reduced equations, as well as performance benefits due to the coupling of the two mechanisms, are discussed and compared with published experimental auditory nerve data.},

  Abstract                 = {We report on the tendency of chaotic systems to be controlled
onto their unstable periodic orbits in such a way that these orbits are
stabilized. The resulting orbits are known as cupolets and collectively
provide a rich source of qualitative information on the associated
chaotic dynamical system. We show that pairs of interacting cupolets may
be induced into a state of mutually sustained stabilization that requires
no external intervention in order to be maintained and is thus considered
bound or entangled. A number of properties of this sort of entanglement
are discussed. For instance, should the interaction be disturbed, then
the chaotic entanglement would be broken. Based on certain properties of
chaotic systems and on examples which we present, there is further
potential for chaotic entanglement to be naturally occurring. A
discussion of this and of the implications of chaotic entanglement in
future research investigations is also presented.},

Appropriate periods and initial states for the Newton method are chosen efficiently by setting a threshold to the range of the minimum distance and the period.}

As a result, the previous conclusion regarding the noninvariance of chaos in cosmology, a major claim about chaos in general relativity, necessarily involves the violation of hypotheses required for a proper definition of the Lyapunov exponents.},

The answers to the first and third questions show that inertial and uniformly rotating observers agree on a characterization of chaos based on {LEs.} The second question, on the other hand, is an ill-posed problem due to the event horizons inherent to uniformly accelerated observers.},

the original problem is reformulated as a partial differential algebraic
equation system by decomposing the solution into a group component and a
spatial shape component, imposing appropriate algebraic constraints on
the decomposition. The system is then projected onto a reduced basis
space. We show that efficient online evaluation of the scheme is possible
and study a numerical example showing its strongly improved performance
in comparison to a scheme without freezing. },

  Abstract                 = {Overdense plasmas are usually opaque to laser light. However, when the light is of sufficient intensity to drive electrons in the plasma to near light speeds, the plasma becomes transparent. This process?known as relativistic transparency?takes just a tenth of a picosecond. Yet all studies of relativistic transparency so far have been restricted to measurements collected over timescales much longer than this, limiting our understanding of the dynamics of this process. Here we present time-resolved electric field measurements (with a temporal resolution of {\textasciitilde} 50 fs) of the light, initially reflected from, and subsequently transmitted through, an expanding overdense plasma. Our result provides insight into the dynamics of the transparent-overdense regime of relativistic plasmas, which should be useful in the development of laser-driven particle accelerators, X-ray sources and techniques for controlling the shape and contrast of intense laser pulses.},

  Abstract                 = {[...] the first Lyapunov vector (LV) is associated with the largest Lyapunov exponent and indicates at any point on the attractor the direction of maximal growth in tangent space. The LV corresponding to the second largest Lyapunov exponent generally points in a different direction, but tangencies between both vectors can in principle occur. Here we find that the probability density function (PDF) of the angle ... spanned by the first and second LVs should be expected to be approximately symmetric around p/4 and to peak at 0 and p/2. Moreover, for small angles we uncover a scaling law for the PDF Q of ? l = ln?? with the system size L : Q (? l ) = L -1/2 f (? l L -1/2 ). We give a theoretical argument that justifies this scaling form and also explains why it should be universal (irrespective of the system details) for spatio-temporal chaos in one spatial dimension. This article is part of a special issue of Journal of Physics A: Mathematical and Theoretical devoted to `Lyapunov analysis: from dynamical systems theory to applications'.},

  Abstract                 = {The goal of this paper is twofold. In the first part we discuss a general approach to determine Lyapunov exponents from ensemble- rather than time-averages. The approach passes through the identification of locally stable and unstable manifolds (the Lyapunov vectors), thereby revealing an analogy with generalized synchronization. The method is then applied to a periodically forced chaotic oscillator to show that the modulus of the Lyapunov exponent associated to the phase dynamics increases quadratically with the coupling strength and it is therefore different from zero already below the onset of phase-synchronization. The analytical calculations are carried out for a model, the generalized special flow, that we construct as a simplified version of the periodically forced Rossler oscillator.}

  Abstract                 = {The study of periodic orbits for dynamical systems dates back to the very origins of the subject. This chapter provides an overview of some of the main results without any claims of being exhaustive. The fundamental problem in the study of zeta functions is to understand the analytic domain of such functions or more generally the meromorphic domain. In many interesting cases, these domains extend far beyond the initial domain of convergence of the series. The chapter discusses dynamical variant on the study of the Lefschetz zeta function. This serves to illustrate an important theme in the study of dynamical zeta functions, namely that local data (e.g., periodic orbits) can have a bearing on the global properties of the transformation f. In particular, this involves the idea of characterizing closed orbits as either twisted or untwisted. The Lefschetz zeta function then reflects the balance between these two types of orbits.},

If the coupling coefficient passes through the critical value, some of the steady states disappear. Meanwhile there are no new steady states created as varies.

As the driver amplitude is increased, the system undergoes a transition from quasiperiodicity to temporal chaos, then to spatiotemporal chaos. The resulting intermittent time series of spatiotemporal chaos displays random switching between laminar and bursty phases. We identify temporally and spatiotemporally chaotic saddles which are responsible for the laminar and bursty phases, respectively. Prior to the transition to spatiotemporal chaos, a spatiotemporally chaotic saddle is responsible for chaotic transients that mimic the dynamics of the post-transition attractor.}

In the present paper, it is demonstrated that a similar mechanism is present in the damped Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation. Prior to the onset of STC, a spatiotemporally chaotic saddle coexists with a spatially regular attractor. After the transition to STC, the chaotic saddle merges with the attractor, generating intermittent bursts of STC that dominate the post-transition dynamics.}

They represent short wavelength solutions composed of k Fourier modes and can be interpreted as embedded lattices with periodic boundary conditions and only k particles. Inside these invariant manifolds other invariant structures and exact solutions are found which represent for instance periodic and quasi-periodic solutions and standing and travelling waves. Similar invariant manifolds exist also in the Klein-Gordon (KG) lattice and in the thermodynamic and continuum limits.}

  Abstract                 = {Many areas of science depend on exploratory data analysis and visualization. The need to analyze large amounts of multivariate data raises the fundamental problem of dimensionality reduction: how to discover compact representations of high-dimensional data. Here, we introduce locally linear embedding {(LLE),} an unsupervised learning algorithm that computes low-dimensional, neighborhood-preserving embeddings of high-dimensional inputs. Unlike clustering methods for local dimensionality reduction, {LLE} maps its inputs into a single global coordinate system of lower dimensionality, and its optimizations do not involve local minima. By exploiting the local symmetries of linear reconstructions, {LLE} is able to learn the global structure of nonlinear manifolds, such as those generated by images of faces or documents of text.},

  Abstract                 = {We present a general method for analysing and numerically solving partial differential equations with self-similar solutions. The method employs ideas from symmetry reduction in geometric mechanics, and involves separating the dynamics on the shape space (which determines the overall shape of the solution) from those on the group space (which determines the size and scale of the solution). The method is computationally tractable as well, allowing one to compute self-similar solutions by evolving a dynamical system to a steady state, in a scaled reference frame where the self-similarity has been factored out. More generally, bifurcation techniques can be used to find self-similar solutions, and determine their behaviour as parameters in the equations are varied. The method is given for an arbitrary Lie group, providing equations for the dynamics on the reduced space, for reconstructing the full dynamics and for determining the resulting scaling laws for self-similar solutions. We illustrate the technique with a numerical example, computing self-similar solutions of the Burgers equation}

The techniques in this paper contribute to the general procedure of removing variables associated with the symmetry of a problem, and related ideas have been used in previous works both to identify coherent structures in solutions of {PDEs,} and to derive low-order models via Galerkin projection. The main result of this paper is to derive a simple and easily implementable set of reconstruction equations which close the system of {ODEs} produced by Galerkin projection. The geometric interpretation of the method closely parallels techniques used in geometric phases and reconstruction techniques in geometric mechanics. We apply the method to the {Kuramoto-Sivashinsky} equation and are able to derive accurate models of considerably lower dimension than are possible with the traditional {Karhunen-Lo\'eve} expansion.}

The main properties of the waves as a function of their group velocities, wavevectors, and frequencies are studied, as well as bifurcations of the dynamical system that describes the waves when the parameter controlling the phase modulation changes from zero to a finite value.

  Abstract                 = {This paper discusses the existence of solitary electromagnetic waves trapped in a self-generated Langmuir wave and embedded in an infinitely long circularly polarized electromagnetic wave propagating through a plasma. From a mathematical point of view they are exact solutions of the one-dimensional relativistic cold fluid plasma model with nonvanishing boundary conditions. Under the assumption of travelling wave solutions with velocity V and vector potential frequency ?, the fluid model is reduced to a Hamiltonian system. The solitary waves are homoclinic (grey solitons) or heteroclinic (dark solitons) orbits to fixed points. Using a dynamical systems description of the Hamiltonian system and a spectral method, we identify a large variety of solitary waves, including asymmetric ones, discuss their disappearance for certain parameter values and classify them according to (i) grey or dark character, (ii) the number of humps of the vector potential envelope and (iii) their symmetries. The solutions come in continuous families in the parametric V?? plane and extend up to velocities that approach the speed of light. The stability of certain types of grey solitary waves is investigated with the aid of particle-in-cell simulations that demonstrate their propagation for a few tens of the inverse of the plasma frequency.},

  Abstract                 = {The {Oberbeck-Boussinesq} equations are reduced to a two-dimensional form governing convection between two free surfaces maintained at a constant temperature difference. These equations are then transformed to a set of ordinary differential equations governing the time variations of the {double-Fourier} coefficients for the motion and temperature fields. Non-linear transfer processes are retained and appear as quadratic interactions between the Fourier coefficients. Energy and heat transfer relations appropriate to this Fourier resolution, and a numerical method for solution from arbitrary initial conditions are given. As examples of the method, numerical solutions for a highly truncated Fourier representation are presented. These solutions, which are for a fixed Prandtl number and variable Rayleigh numbers, show the transient growth of convection from small perturbations, and in all cases studied approach steady states. The steady states obtained agree favorably with steady-state solutions obtained by previous investigators.}

For small amplitude solitons with zero phase difference, we observe the formation of an oscillating bound state whose period depends on their initial separation.

The following conclusions are obtained: (1) The statistical properties of the Lorenz system can be reduced to those of 1-dimensional Ising system with short-range interaction, in other words, the time correlation function of the Lorenz system shows no singular long-time behaviour.

When the advection term in the Vlasov equation is dominant, the convergence with N of the eigenvalues is rather slow, limiting the applicability of the method. We use the method of spectral deformation introduced by Crawford and Hislop Ann. Phys. ({NY)} 189 265 (1989) to selectively damp the continuum of neutral modes associated with the advection term, thus accelerating convergence. We validate and benchmark the performance of our method by reproducing the kinetic dispersion relation results for linear (spatially homogeneous) equilibria. Finally, we study the stability of a periodic Bernstein-Greene-Kruskal mode with multiple phase-space vortices, compare our results with numerical simulations of the Vlasov-Poisson system, and show that the initial unstable equilibrium may evolve to different asymptotic states depending on the way it was perturbed.},

A comparison of particle-in-cell simulations to the predictions of a relativistic cold-fluid model for the transparency threshold demonstrates that kinetic effects, such as electron heating, can lead to a substantial increase of the effective critical density compared to cold-fluid theory. These results are interpreted by a study of separatrices in the single-electron phase space corresponding to dynamics in the stationary fields predicted by the cold-fluid model. It is shown that perturbations due to electron heating exceeding a certain finite threshold can force electrons to escape into the vacuum, leading to laser pulse propagation. The modification of the transparency threshold is linked to the temporal pulse profile, through its effect on electron heating.},

 such systems are ergodic and are K -systems. The basic method of
 investigation is the construction of transversal foliations for such

We show that for one-dimensional interval maps the corresponding quantities, that is, Lyapunov exponents and exponential decay rates, are related. More specifically, for piecewise linear expanding Markov maps observed via piecewise analytic functions, we show that the decay rate is bounded above by twice the Lyapunov exponent, that is, we establish lower bounds for the subleading eigenvalue of the corresponding Perron-Frobenius operator. In addition, we comment on similar relations for general piecewise smooth expanding maps.},

We argue that the standard capillary number used to describe this process is inadequate since it does not account for advection of a drop between regions of the flow with varying velocity gradient. Consequently, we propose a Lagrangian-generalized capillary number CL number based on finite-time Lyapunov exponents. We present preliminary tests of this formalism for the stretching of a single drop of oil in an oscillating vortex flow, which has been shown previously to exhibit Lagrangian chaos. Probability distribution functions (PDFs) of the stretching of this drop have features that are similar to PDFs of CL. We also discuss on-going experiments that we have begun on drop stretching in a blinking vortex flow. PACS: 47.52.+j; 47.55.Dz; 94.10.Lf },

  Abstract                 = {Scientists working with large volumes of high-dimensional data, such as global climate patterns, stellar spectra, or human gene distributions, regularly confront the problem of dimensionality reduction: finding meaningful low-dimensional structures hidden in their high-dimensional observations. The human brain confronts the same problem in everyday perception, extracting from its high-dimensional sensory inputs -30,000 auditory nerve fibers or 106 optic nerve fibers- manageably small number of perceptually relevant features. Here we describe an approach to solving dimensionality reduction problems that uses easily measured local metric information to learn the underlying global geometry of a data set. Unlike classical techniques such as principal component analysis (PCA) and multidimensional scaling (MDS), our approach is capable of discovering the nonlinear degrees of freedom that underlie complex natural observations, such as human handwriting or images of a face under different viewing conditions. In contrast to previous algorithms for nonlinear dimensionality reduction, ours efficiently computes a globally optimal solution, and, for an important class of data manifolds, is guaranteed to converge asymptotically to the true structure.},

  Abstract                 = {Constraints are found on the spatial variation of finite-time Lyapunov exponents of two and three-dimensional systems of ordinary differential equations. In a chaotic system, finite-time Lyapunov exponents describe the average rate of separation, along characteristic directions, of neighboring trajectories. The solution of the equations is a coordinate transformation that takes initial conditions (the Lagrangian coordinates) to the state of the system at a later time (the Eulerian coordinates). This coordinate transformation naturally defines a metric tensor, from which the Lyapunov exponents and characteristic directions are obtained. By requiring that the Riemann curvature tensor vanish for the metric tensor (a basic result of differential geometry in a flat space), differential constraints relating the finite-time Lyapunov exponents to the characteristic directions are derived. These constraints are realized with exponential accuracy in time. A consequence of the relations is that the finite-time Lyapunov exponents are locally small in regions where the curvature of the stable manifold is large, which has implications for the efficiency of chaotic mixing in the advection-diffusion equation. The constraints also modify previous estimates of the asymptotic growth rates of quantities in the dynamo problem, such as the magnitude of the induced current.}

  Abstract                 = {In a smooth flow, the leading-order response of trajectories to infinitesimal perturbations in their initial conditions is described by the finite-time Lyapunov exponents and associated characteristic directions of stretching. We give a description of the second-order response to perturbations in terms of Lagrangian derivatives of the exponents and characteristic directions. These derivatives are related to generalised Lyapunov exponents, which describe deformations of phase space elements beyond ellipsoidal. When the flow is chaotic, care must be taken in evaluating the derivatives because of the exponential discrepancy in scale along the different characteristic directions. Two matrix decomposition methods are used to isolate the directions of stretching, the first appropriate in finding the asymptotic behaviour of the derivatives analytically, the second better suited to numerical evaluation. The derivatives are shown to satisfy differential constraints that are realised with exponential accuracy in time. With a suitable reinterpretation, the results of the paper are shown to apply to the Eulerian framework as well.}

  Abstract                 = { A key a priori information used in 4DVar is the knowledge of the system's evolution equations. We propose a method for taking full advantage of the knowledge of the system's dynamical instabilities in order to improve the quality of the analysis. We present an algorithm, four-dimensional variational assimilation in the unstable subspace (4DVar-AUS), that consists in confining in this subspace the increment of the control variable. The existence of an optimal subspace dimension for this confinement is hypothesized. Theoretical arguments in favor of the present approach are supported by numerical experiments in a simple perfect non-linear model scenario. It is found that the RMS analysis error is a function of the dimension N of the subspace where the analysis is confined and is minimum for N approximately equal to the dimension of the unstable and neutral manifold. For all assimilation windows, from 1 to 5 days, 4DVar-AUS performs better than standard 4DVar. In the presence of observational noise, the 4DVar solution, while being closer to the observations, if farther away from the truth. The implementation of 4DVar-AUS does not require the adjoint integration. }

These vectors, called Lyapunov vectors, can be considered the generalization to aperiodic orbits of the normal modes of the instability problem and are not necessarily mutually orthogonal. The relation between singular vectors and Lyapunov vectors is clarified. The mechanism responsible for super-Lyapunov growth is shown to be related to the nonorthogonality of Lyapunov vectors. The leading Lyapunov vectors, as defined here, as well as the asymptotic final singular vectors, are tangent to the attractor, while the leading initial singular vectors, in general, point away from it. Perturbations that are on the attractor can be found in the subspace of the leading Lyapunov vectors.}

  Abstract                 = {Perturbed plane Couette flow containing a thin spanwise-oriented ribbon undergoes a subcritical bifurcation at Re = 230 to a steady 3D state containing streamwise vortices. This bifurcation is followed by several others giving rise to a fascinating series of stable and unstable steady states of different symmetries and wavelengths. First, the backwards-bifurcating branch reverses direction and becomes stable near Re = 200. Then, the spanwise reflection symmetry is broken, leading to two asymmetric branches which are themselves destabilized at Re = 420. Above this Reynolds number, time evolution leads first to a metastable state whose spanwise wavelength is halved and then to complicated time-dependent behavior. These features are in agreement with experiments.}

These wavefunctions, which are constructed in the vicinity of a periodic orbit with maximum energy localization, provide a precise definition of a scar function .

This general effect opens the way to a new generation of light sources, particularly suitable for attosecond pump-probe experiments, and provides a new tool for ultrafast metrology, for instance, giving direct access to fluctuations of the carrier-envelope relative phase of even the most intense ultrashort lasers.},

In the present study we show that the technique of periodic orbit quantization by harmonic inversion of trace formulae, which does not rely on the existence of a complete symbolic dynamics or other specific properties, lends itself ideally to calculating semiclassical eigenvalues from periodic orbit data even in strongly pruned systems. We apply the harmonic inversion technique to cross-correlated periodic orbit sums, which allows us to reduce the required number of orbits. The power, and the limitations, of the method in its present form are demonstrated for the closed three-disk billiard as a prime example of a classically chaotic bound system with strong pruning.}

  Abstract                 = {The nonlinear interaction of an intense femtosecond laser pulse with matter can lead to the emission of a train of sub-laser-cycle?attosecond?bursts of short-wavelength radiation. Much effort has been devoted to producing isolated attosecond pulses, as these are better suited to real-time imaging of fundamental electronic processes. Successful methods developed so far rely on confining the nonlinear interaction to a single sub-cycle event. Here, we demonstrate for the first time a simpler and more universal approach to this problem, applied to nonlinear laser?plasma interactions. By rotating the instantaneous wavefront direction of an intense few-cycle laser field as it interacts with a solid-density plasma, we separate the nonlinearly generated attosecond pulse train into multiple beams of isolated attosecond pulses propagating in different and controlled directions away from the plasma surface. This unique method produces a manifold of isolated attosecond pulses, ideally synchronized for initiating and probing ultrafast electron motion in matter.},

In large scales, the dynamics is Gaussian. In the intermediate scales, the dynamics is reminiscent of travelling waves and heteroclinic cyces which is the typical behavior for small system size. In the small scales, the dynamics is intermittent. Through investigation of the interaction between different scales, we see the intermediate structures give the defining shape of the cell and the large scales trigger the spatiotemporal chaos. The small scales dissipate energy and modify the background in a average sense.}

An efficient, norm-independent method for constructing the n most rapidly growing Lyapunov vectors from n-1 leading forward and n leading backward asymptotic singular vectors is proposed. The Lyapunov vectors so constructed are invariant under the linearized flow in the sense that, once computed at one time, they are defined, in principle, for all time through the tangent linear propagator. An analogous method allows the construction of the n most rapidly decaying Lyapunov vectors from n decaying forward and n-1 decaying backward singular vectors.}

It works by projecting vector differences between reference states and recurrent states onto local linear subspaces spanned by the Lyapunov vectors. A sharp characteristic transition of the projection error occurs as soon as the number of basis vectors is increased beyond the inertial manifold dimension. Since the method can be applied using standard orthogonal Lyapunov vectors, it provides a possible way to also determine experimentally inertial manifolds and their geometric characteristics.}

  Abstract                 = {Numerical and analytical evidence is presented to show that hydrodynamic Lyapunov modes ({HLMs)} do exist in lattices of coupled Hamiltonian and dissipative maps. More importantly, we find that {HLMs} in these two classes of systems are different with respect to their spatial structure and their dynamical behavior. To be concrete, the corresponding dispersion relations of Lyapunov exponent versus wave number are characterized by ??k and ??k2, respectively. The {HLMs} in Hamiltonian systems are propagating, whereas those of dissipative systems show only diffusive motion. Extensive numerical simulations of various systems confirm that the existence of {HLMs} is a very general feature of extended dynamical systems with continuous symmetries and that the above-mentioned differences between the two classes of systems are universal in large extent.},

  Abstract                 = {Two sets of vectors, covariant Lyapunov vectors (CLVs) and orthogonal Lyapunov vectors (OLVs), are currently used to characterize the linear stability of chaotic systems. A comparison is made to show their similarity and difference, especially with respect to the influence on hydrodynamic Lyapunov modes (HLMs). Our numerical simulations show that in both Hamiltonian and dissipative systems HLMs formerly detected via OLVs survive if CLVs are used instead. Moreover, the previous classification of two universality classes works for CLVs as well, i.e., the dispersion relation is linear for Hamiltonian systems and quadratic for dissipative systems, respectively. The significance of HLMs changes in different ways for Hamiltonian and dissipative systems with the replacement of OLVs with CLVs. For general dissipative systems with nonhyperbolic dynamics the long-wavelength structure in Lyapunov vectors corresponding to near-zero Lyapunov exponents is strongly reduced if CLVs are used instead, whereas for highly hyperbolic dissipative systems the significance of HLMs is nearly identical for CLVs and OLVs. In contrast the HLM significance of Hamiltonian systems is always comparable for CLVs and OLVs irrespective of hyperbolicity. We also find that in Hamiltonian systems different symmetry relations between conjugate pairs are observed for CLVs and OLVs. Especially, CLVs in a conjugate pair are statistically indistinguishable in consequence of the microreversibility of Hamiltonian systems. Transformation properties of Lyapunov exponents, CLVs, and hyperbolicity under changes of coordinate are discussed in appendices.},

Numerical results for coupled map lattices are presented to show the importance of DOS for observing good HLMs. This is achieved by relating splitting parameters to the maximum value of the Lyapunov mode structure factor.},

  Abstract                 = {The complex interactions between spatial and temporal components of the dynamics, known as spatiotemporal chaos, only recently begun to be studied using ideas from fundamental dynamical systems theory (Temam, 1988; Goren et al. 1995; Christiansen et al. 1997). The present dissertation is primarily interested in studying the appearance of global bifurcations in two specific physical examples, a laser with an injected signal, and a catalytic reaction on a platinum surface. Characteristic of these bifurcations is the presence of a highly degenerate .... One of the main motivations to study these equations is that some of them display spatiotemporal chaos, which in many ways, resembles turbulence in fluid dynamics. Recently, different efforts to uncover the dynamical origin for these complex states have been developing (Goren et al. 1995; Christiansen et al. 1997).}
