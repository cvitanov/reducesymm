  abstract = {Numerical studies of the laser-Lorenz model using
         parameters reasonably accessible for recent
         experiments with a single mode homogeneously
         broadened laser demonstrate that the form of the
         return map of successive peak values of the
         intensity changes from a sharply cusped map in
         resonance to a map with a smoothly rounded maximum
         as the laser is detuned into the period doubling
         regime. This transformation appears to be related to
         the disappearance (with detuning) of the
         heteroclinic structural basis for the stable
         manifold which exists in resonance. This is in
         contrast to the evidence reported by Tang and Weiss
         (Phys. Rev. A 49 (1994) 1296) of a cusped map for
         both the period doubling chaos found with detuning
         and the spiral chaos found in resonance for
         seemingly Lorenz-like behavior of the far-infrared
         ammonia laser from which it was concluded that there
         existed a ?unique chaotic attractor for a
         single-mode laser?. }

  abstract = {We present an approach to the design of
feedback control laws that stabilize relative equilibria of
general nonlinear systems with continuous symmetry. Using a
template-based method, we factor out the dynamics associated
with the symmetry variables and obtain evolution equations in a
reduced frame that evolves in the symmetry direction. The
relative equilibria of the original systems are fixed points of
these reduced equations. Our controller design methodology is
based on the linearization of the reduced equations about such
fixed points. We present two different approaches of control
design. The first approach assumes that the closed loop system
is affine in the control and that the actuation is equivariant.
We derive feedback laws for the reduced system that minimize a
quadratic cost function. The second approach is more general;
here the actuation need not be equivariant, but the actuators
can be translated in the symmetry direction. The controller
resulting from this approach leaves the dynamics associated
with the symmetry variable unchanged. Both approaches are
simple to implement, as they use standard tools available from
linear control theory. We illustrate the approaches on three
examples: a rotationally invariant planar {ODE,} an inverted
pendulum on a cart, and the {Kuramoto-Sivashinsky} equation
with periodic boundary conditions.}

to discrete-time systems, we first introduce the concept of periodic
transfer function from which a notion of generalized frequency response
can be worked out. Then we discuss the following four reformulations:
(i) time lifted, (ii) cyclic, (iii) frequency lifted and
(iv) Fourier. A number of interesting links will be established, and
many theoretical aspects somewhat overlooked in the existing literature
will be clarified. All reformulations are first worked out from the
input--output description and then elaborated in a state-space formalism.

The authors review the concept of multifractal sets in both turbulent flows and dynamical systems using a generalisation of the beta -model.}

  abstract = {
A fundamental class of solutions of symmetric {Hamiltonian} systems is
relative equilibria. In this paper the nonlinear problem near a
degenerate relative equilibrium is considered. The degeneracy creates a
saddle-center and attendant homoclinic bifurcation in the reduced system
transverse to the group orbit. The surprising result is that the
curvature of the pullback of the momentum map to the Lie algebra
determines the normal form for the homoclinic bifurcation. There is also
an induced directional geometric phase in the homoclinic bifurcation. The
backbone of the analysis is the use of singularity theory for smooth
mappings between manifolds applied to the pullback of the momentum map.
The theory is constructive and generalities are given for symmetric
Hamiltonian systems on a vector space of dimension (2n+2) with an
n-dimensional abelian symmetry group. Examples for n=1,2,3 are presented
to illustrate application of the theory.}

  a Markov case for holes of finite-size . Moreover, a general relation
  between the transfer operators of the closed and corresponding open
  systems, together with the generating function of the probability of
  return to the hole is derived. This relation is then used to compute
  the small hole asymptotic behavior, in terms of readily calculable
  quantities. As an example we derive logarithmic corrections in the
  second order term. Being valid for Markov systems, our framework can
  find application in many areas of the physical sciences such as
  information theory, network theory, quantum Weyl law and, via Ulam{\textquoteright}s
  method, can be used as an approximation method in general dynamical
  systems.},

    we address the problems of applying this formalism to bound chaotic
    systems, caused by e.g. intermittency and non-completeness of the
    symbolic dynamics. For bound intermittent systems we derive an approximation
    of the zeta function. With the aid of this zeta function it is argued
    that bound systems with long time tails have branch cuts in the zeta
    function and traces (of the evolution operator) approaching unity
    as a power law. We also show that the dominant time scale can be
    much longer than the period of the shortest periodic orbit, as is,
    for example, the case for the hyperbola billiard. Isolated zeros
    of the zeta function for the hyperbola billiard are evaluated by
    means of a cycle expansion. Crucial for the success of this approach
    is the identification of a sequence of periodic orbit responsible
    for a logarithmic branch cut in the zeta function. Semiclassical
    implications are briefly discussed.}

    in terms of the probability distribution of laminar lengths. In particular
    we study a one-parameter family of weights. Depending on the parameter
    the trace can be dominated by branch cuts in the zeta function or
    by isolated zeros. In the former case the time dependence of the
    trace is dominated by a power law and in the latter case by an exponential.
    A phase transition occurs when the leading zero collides with a branch

We study the {Kuramoto-Sivashinky} equation with periodic
boundary conditions in the case of low-dimensional behavior. We
analyze the bifurcations that occur in a six-dimensional {(6D)}
approximation of its inertial manifold. We mainly focus on the
attracting and structurally stable heteroclinic connections
that arise for these parameter values. We reanalyze the ones
that were previously described via a {4D} reduction to the
center-unstable manifold {(Ambruster} et al., 1988, 1989). We
also find a parameter region for which a manifold of
structurally stable heteroclinic cycles exist. The existence of
such a manifold is responsible for an intermittent behavior
which has some features of unpredictability.}

reflections from an extended collection of scatterers, has been a useful
model of deterministic diffusion and related statistical properties for
over a century. This survey summarises recent results, including periodic
and aperiodic models, finite and infinite horizon, external fields,
smooth or polygonal obstacles, and in the {Boltzmann-Grad} limit. New
results are given for several moving particles and for obstacles with
flat points. Finally, a variety of applications are presented.}

    Simu'o, as the mass of one of the bodies is allowed to
    vary. In particular, we show how the invariances
    (phase-shift, scaling law, and x, y, z translations and
    rotations) can be dealt with. Our numerical results show,
    among other things, that there exists a continuous path
    of periodic solutions from the figure-8 orbit to a
    periodic solution of the restricted 3-body problem.}

  the temporal correlation in one-dimensional time series {ut; t=0,1,2,3,

  studying poles of the Fourier transform of the moment Mt(q) $\equiv$$\ll$exp
  (qtzt) >, where zt$\equiv$t-1{$\Sigma$}t-1j=0 uj is the scale-dependent average and the
  parameter q is real. The temporal correlations turn out to be specified
  with sets of characteristic frequencies {$\omega$q} and line widths {$\gamma$q} . It
  is shown that the conventional double-time correlation function theory
  deals only with the limit q $\rightarrow$0. Furthermore we will find that {$\omega$q} and
  {$\gamma$q} generally depend on q. This implies that different characteristic
  dynamics embedded in {ut} , including motions which can be never
  described by the double-time correlation function approach, are able to
  be singled out in a unified way by controlling the parameter q.},

   Lie groups in the context of equivariant bifurcation theory. We start
   by extending the theory developed by Field and Richardson {[}37] for
   absolutely irreducible representations of finite groups to general
   irreducible representations of compact Lie groups. In particular, we
   allow for branches of relative equilibria and phenomena such as the
   Hopf bifurcation. We also present a general theory of determinacy for
   irreducible Lie group actions along the lines previously described in
   Field {[}29]. In the main result of this work, we show that branching
   patterns for generic equivariant bifurcation problems defined on
   irreducible representations persist under perturbations by sufficiently
   high order non-equivariant terms. We give applications of this result
   to normal form computations yielding, for example, equivariant Hopf
   bifurcations and show how normal form computations of branching and
   stabilities are valid when we take account of the non-normalized tail.}}

{Hamiltonian} dynamics with local confinement, in which interactions
between neighboring particles occur through hard core elastic collisions.
Such dynamics may be described as high-dimensional billiards. We consider
the case where the collisions are rare and, for large systems, derive a
Boltzmann-like equation for the evolution of the probability densities.
We solve this equation in the linear regime and compute the heat
conductivity in the approximate stationary state and with the help of the
Green-Kubo formula. We demonstrate the validity of the molecular chaos
hypothesis by comparing our theoretical predictions to the results of
numerical simulations performed on a new class of models, which are
defocusing chaotic billiards, likened to higher-dimensional stadia.

    operator for 1-D maps having two expanding branches. We show that
    if one branch 'dominates' the other, the dominating branch determines
    the asymptotic form of the spectrum. In particular, we obtain sufficient

Temporal integration of equations possessing continuous
symmetries (e.g. systems with translational invariance
associated with traveling solutions and scale invariance
associated with self-similar solutions) in a "co-evolving"
frame (i.e. a frame which is co-traveling, co-collapsing or
co-exploding with the evolving solution) leads to improved
accuracy because of the smaller time derivative in the new
spatial frame. The slower time behavior permits the use of
projective and coarse projective integration with longer
projective steps in the computation of the time evolution of
partial differential equations and multiscale systems,
respectively. These methods are also demonstrated to be
effective for systems which only approximately or
asymptotically possess continuous symmetries. The ideas of
projective integration in a co-evolving frame are illustrated
on the one-dimensional, translationally invariant Nagumo
partial differential equation {(PDE).} A corresponding kinetic
Monte Carlo model, motivated from the Nagumo kinetics, is used
to illustrate the coarse-grained method. A simple,
one-dimensional diffusion problem is used to illustrate the
scale invariant case. The efficiency of projective integration
in the co-evolving frame for both the macroscopic diffusion
{PDE} and for a random-walker particle based model is again
demonstrated.}

                 through a circular straight pipe remains one of the
                 oldest problems in fluid mechanics. So far no
                 explanation has been substantiated to rationalize the
                 transition process by which the steady unidirectional
                 laminar flow state gives way to a temporally and
                 spatially disordered three-dimensional (turbulent)
                 solution as the flow rate increases. Recently, new
                 travelling wave solutions have been discovered which
                 are saddle points in phase space. These plausibly
                 represent the lowest level in a hierarchy of
                 spatio-temporal periodic flow solutions which may be
                 used to construct a cycle expansion theory of turbulent
                 pipe flows. We summarize this success against the
                 backdrop of past work and discuss its implications for
                 future research.}

dynamical systems theory. Taking the {Kuramoto-Sivashinsky}
equation as a model problem we discuss the {K-L} decomposition
for 4 different values of its bifurcation parameter a. We
distinguish two modes of using the {K-L} decomposition: As an
analytic and synthetic tool respectively. Using the analytic
mode we find unstable fixed points and stable and unstable
manifolds in a parameter regime with structurally stable
homoclinic orbits (a=17.75). Choosing the data for a {K-L}
analysis carefully by restricting them to certain burst events,
we can analyze a more complicated intermittent regime at a=68.
We establish that the spatially localized oscillations around a
so called `strange' fixed point which are considered as
fore-runners of spatially concentrated zones of turbulence are
in fact created by a very specific limit cycle (a=83.75) which,
for a=87, bifurcates into a modulated traveling wave. Using the
{K-L} decomposition synthetically by determining an optimal
Galerkin system, we present evidence that the {K-L}
decomposition systematically destroys dissipation and leads to
blow up solutions.}

  For piecewise C2 expanding interval maps we rigorously prove

  is Lipschitz continuous up to quadratic logarithmic corrections.
  For a special class of piecewise linear maps we provide more precise
  estimates at specific parameter values. Our analytical findings are
  quantified numerically for the latter class of maps by using exact
  expansions for the transport coefficients that can be evaluated
  numerically. We numerically observe strong local variations of all

  one-dimensional setting consisting of a family of four parameter
  dependent, chaotic maps defined over the real line. When iterated under
  these maps, a probability density function spreads out and one can
  define a diffusion coefficient. We look at how the diffusion
  coefficient varies across the family of maps and under parameter
  variation. Using a technique by which Taylor--Green--Kubo formulae are
  evaluated in terms of generalized Takagi functions, we derive exact,
  fully analytical expressions for the diffusion coefficients. Typically,
  for simple maps these quantities are fractal functions of control
  parameters. However, our family of four maps exhibits both fractal and
  linear behaviour. We explain these different structures by looking at
  the topology of the Markov partitions and the ergodic properties of the
  maps.}

    the equations of a two-level geostrophic model in truncated double-Fourier
    series. The model includes the nonlinear interactions among disturbances
    of three different wave lengths. Nonperiodic time-dependent solutions
    are determined by numerical integration.By comparing separate solutions
    with slightly different initial conditions, the growth rate of small
    initial errors is studied. The time required for errors comparable
    to observational errors in the atmosphere to grow to intolerable
    errors is strongly dependent upon the current circulation pattern,
    and varies from a few days to a few weeks.Some statistical predictability
    of certain quantities seems to be present even after errors in the
    complete circulation pattern are no longer small. The feasibility
    of performing similar studies with much larger atmospheric models
    is considered.}

  abstract = {The purpose of this paper is to develop
analytical methods for studyingparticle paths in a class of
three-dimensional incompressible fluid flows. In this paper we
study three-dimensionalvolume preserving vector fields that are
invariant under the action of a one-parameter symmetry group
whose infinitesimal generator is autonomous and
volume-preserving. We show that there exists a coordinate
system in which the vector field assumes a simple form. In
particular, the evolution of two of the coordinates is governed
by a time-dependent, one-degree-of-freedom {Hamiltonian} system
with the evolution of the remaining coordinate being governed
by a first-order differential equation that depends only on the
other two coordinates and time. The new coordinates depend only
on the symmetry group of the vector field. Therefore they
arefield-independent. The coordinate transformation is
constructive. If the vector field is time-independent, then it
possesses an integral of motion. Moreover, we show that the
system can be further reduced toaction-angle-angle coordinates.
These are analogous to the familiar action-angle variables from
Hamiltonian mechanics and are quite useful for perturbative
studies of the class of systems we consider. In fact, we show
how our coordinate transformation puts us in a position to
apply recent extensions of the {Kolmogorov-Arnold-Moser}
{(KAM)} theorem for three-dimensional, volume-preserving maps
as well as three-dimensional versions of Melnikov's method. We
discuss the integrability of the class of flows considered, and
draw an analogy with Clebsch variables in fluid mechanics.}

stochastic model that reproduces the results for chaotic
systems. Our work supports the claims about universality of
our earlier results [I. G. Szendro et al., Phys. Rev. E 76,

  when it is close to a singularity. In particular we study a family of
  intermittent maps, which we argue exhibit a branch point singularity in
  its zeta functions. The convergence of the cycle expansion close to
  this point is extremely slow. To deal with this problem we consider a
  resummation of the cycle expansion. The idea is quite similar to that
  of Pad{\'e} approximants, but the ansatz is a generalized series expansion
  around the branch point rather than a rational function. The
  improvement on convergence of the leading zero is considerable. We also
  briefly discuss the relation between correlation decay and the nature
  of the branch point.}

    some of the main results without any claims of being exhaustive.
    The fundamental problem in the study of zeta functions is to understand
    the analytic domain of such functions or more generally the meromorphic
    domain. In many interesting cases, these domains extend far beyond
    the initial domain of convergence of the series. The chapter discusses
    dynamical variant on the study of the Lefschetz zeta function. This
    serves to illustrate an important theme in the study of dynamical
    zeta functions, namely that local data (e.g., periodic orbits) can
    have a bearing on the global properties of the transformation f.
    In particular, this involves the idea of characterizing closed orbits
    as either twisted or untwisted. The Lefschetz zeta function then
    reflects the balance between these two types of orbits.},

  abstract = {
The Fermi-Pasta-Ulam (FPU) lattice with periodic boundary
conditions and n particles admits a large group of discrete
symmetries. The fixed point sets of these symmetries naturally
form invariant symplectic manifolds that are investigated in
this short note. For each k dividing n we find k degree of
freedom invariant manifolds. They represent short wavelength
solutions composed of k Fourier modes and can be interpreted as
embedded lattices with periodic boundary conditions and only k
particles. Inside these invariant manifolds other invariant
structures and exact solutions are found which represent for
instance periodic and quasi-periodic solutions and standing and
travelling waves. Similar invariant manifolds exist also in the
Klein-Gordon (KG) lattice and in the thermodynamic and
continuum limits.

raises the fundamental problem of dimensionality reduction: how to
discover compact representations of high-dimensional data. Here, we
introduce locally linear embedding {(LLE),} an unsupervised learning
algorithm that computes low-dimensional, neighborhood-preserving
embeddings of high-dimensional inputs. Unlike clustering methods for
local dimensionality reduction, {LLE} maps its inputs into a single
global coordinate system of lower dimensionality, and its optimizations
do not involve local minima. By exploiting the local symmetries of linear
reconstructions, {LLE} is able to learn the global structure of nonlinear
manifolds, such as those generated by images of faces or documents of
text.}

numerically solving partial differential equations with
self-similar solutions. The method employs ideas from
symmetry reduction in geometric mechanics, and involves
separating the dynamics on the shape space (which determines
the overall shape of the solution) from those on the group
space (which determines the size and scale of the solution).
The method is computationally tractable as well, allowing one
to compute self-similar solutions by evolving a dynamical
system to a steady state, in a scaled reference frame where
the self-similarity has been factored out. More generally,
bifurcation techniques can be used to find self-similar
solutions, and determine their behaviour as parameters in the
equations are varied. The method is given for an arbitrary
Lie group, providing equations for the dynamics on the
reduced space, for reconstructing the full dynamics and for
determining the resulting scaling laws for self-similar
solutions. We illustrate the technique with a numerical
example, computing self-similar solutions of the Burgers
equation}

  abstract = {The {Oberbeck-Boussinesq} equations are reduced
to a two-dimensional form governing convection
between two free surfaces maintained at a constant temperature
difference. These equations are then transformed to a set of
ordinary differential equations governing the time variations
of the {double-Fourier} coefficients for the motion and
temperature fields. Non-linear transfer processes are retained
and appear as quadratic interactions between the Fourier
coefficients. Energy and heat transfer relations appropriate to
this Fourier resolution, and a numerical method for solution
from arbitrary initial conditions are given. As examples of the
method, numerical solutions for a highly truncated Fourier
representation are presented. These solutions, which are for a
fixed Prandtl number and variable Rayleigh numbers, show the
transient growth of convection from small perturbations, and in
all cases studied approach steady states. The steady states
obtained agree favorably with steady-state solutions obtained
by previous investigators.}

  abstract = {We study the hyperbola billiard, a strongly chaotic
system whose classical dynamics is the free motion of a particle with
elastic reflections on the boundary. The corresponding quantum
mechanical problem is to determine the bound state energies as
eigenvalues of the Dirichlet Laplacian on D. It is shown that the
classical periodic orbits of the hyperbola billiard can be
effectively enumerated by a ternary code. Combining this code with an
extremum principle, we are able to determine with high precision more
than 500 000 primitive periodic orbits together with their lengths,
multiplicities and {Lyapunov} exponents. The statistical properties of
the length spectrum of the periodic orbits are found to be consistent
with a random walk model, which in turn predicts asymptotically an
exponential proliferation of long periodic orbits and leads to a
novel formula for the topological entropy, whose value turns out to
be approximately 0.6. The periodic orbits are used for a quantitative
test of Gutzwiller's periodic-orbit theory, which plays the role of a
semiclassical quantization rule. We find that the predictions of the
periodic-orbit theory for the Gaussian level density agree at low
energies surprisingly well with the tru results obtained from a
numerical solution of the Schr\"odinger equation.}

periodic discrete-time systems through the use of linear periodic state
feedback. The proposed method uses reliable numerical techniques based on
unitary transformations. In essence, it computes the Schur form of the
open-loop monodromy matrix via a recent implicit eigen-decomposition
algorithm, and shifts its eigenvalues sequentially. Given complete
reachability of the open-loop system, we show that we can assign an
arbitrary set of eigenvalues to the closed-loop monodromy matrix in this
manner. Under the weaker assumption of complete control-lability, this
method can be used to place all eigenvalues at the origin, thus solving
the so-called deadbeat control problem. The algorithm readily extends to
more general situations, such as when the system equation is given in
descriptor form.}

feedback control laws that stabilize the relative equilibria of
general nonlinear systems with continuous symmetry. Using a
template-based method, we factor out the dynamics associated
with the symmetry variables and obtain evolution equations in a
reduced frame that evolves in the symmetry direction. The
relative equilibria of the original system are fixed points of
these reduced equations. Our controller design methodology is
based on the linearization of the reduced equations about such
fixed points. Assuming equivariant actuation, we derive
feedback laws for the reduced system that are optimal in the
sense that they minimize a quadratic cost function. We
illustrate the method by stabilizing unstable traveling waves
of a dissipative {PDE} possessing translational invariance}

    finite-time {Lyapunov} exponents of two and three-dimensional systems
    of ordinary differential equations. In a chaotic system, finite-time
 {Lyapunov} exponents describe the average rate of separation, along
    characteristic directions, of neighboring trajectories. The solution
    of the equations is a coordinate transformation that takes initial
    conditions (the Lagrangian coordinates) to the state of the system at
    a later time (the Eulerian coordinates). This coordinate
    transformation naturally defines a metric tensor, from which the
 {Lyapunov} exponents and characteristic directions are obtained. By
    requiring that the Riemann curvature tensor vanish for the metric
    tensor (a basic result of differential geometry in a flat space),
    differential constraints relating the finite-time {Lyapunov} exponents
    to the characteristic directions are derived. These constraints are
    realized with exponential accuracy in time. A consequence of the
    relations is that the finite-time {Lyapunov} exponents are locally
    small in regions where the curvature of the stable manifold is large,
    which has implications for the efficiency of chaotic mixing in the
    advection-diffusion equation. The constraints also modify previous
    estimates of the asymptotic growth rates of quantities in the dynamo
    problem, such as the magnitude of the induced current.}

orbit. These vectors, called {Lyapunov} vectors, can be
considered the generalization to aperiodic orbits of the
normal modes of the instability problem and are not
necessarily mutually orthogonal. The relation between
singular vectors and {Lyapunov} vectors is clarified. The
mechanism responsible for super-Lyapunov growth is shown to
be related to the nonorthogonality of {Lyapunov} vectors. The
leading {Lyapunov} vectors, as defined here, as well as the
asymptotic final singular vectors, are tangent to the
attractor, while the leading initial singular vectors, in
general, point away from it. Perturbations that are on the
attractor can be found in the subspace of the leading
Lyapunov vectors.}

  A key a priori information used in 4DVar is the knowledge of the
system's evolution equations. We propose a method for taking full
advantage of the knowledge of the system's dynamical instabilities in
order to improve the quality of the analysis. We present an
algorithm, four-dimensional variational assimilation in the unstable
subspace (4DVar-AUS), that consists in confining in this subspace the
increment of the control variable. The existence of an optimal
subspace dimension for this confinement is hypothesized. Theoretical
arguments in favor of the present approach are supported by numerical
experiments in a simple perfect non-linear model scenario. It is
found that the RMS analysis error is a function of the dimension N of
the subspace where the analysis is confined and is minimum for N
approximately equal to the dimension of the unstable and neutral
manifold. For all assimilation windows, from 1 to 5 days, 4DVar-AUS
performs better than standard 4DVar. In the presence of observational
noise, the 4DVar solution, while being closer to the observations, if
farther away from the truth. The implementation of 4DVar-AUS does not
require the adjoint integration.

{Re = 230} to a steady 3D state containing streamwise vortices.
This bifurcation is followed by several others giving rise to a
fascinating series of stable and unstable steady states of
different symmetries and wavelengths. First, the
backwards-bifurcating branch reverses direction and becomes
stable near {Re = 200}. Then, the spanwise reflection symmetry is
broken, leading to two asymmetric branches which are themselves
destabilized at {Re = 420}. Above this Reynolds number, time
evolution leads first to a metastable state whose spanwise
wavelength is halved and then to complicated time-dependent
behavior. These features are in agreement with experiments.}

systems. We state and prove a necessary and sufficient condition for a

the transform when it does exist. Our results also extend to generalized

  abstract = {In ballistic open quantum systems, one often observes that
  the resonances in the complex-energy plane form a clear chain
  structure. Taking the open three-disk system as a paradigmatic model
  system, we investigate how this chain structure is reflected in the
  resonance states and how it is connected to the underlying classical
  dynamics. Using an efficient scattering approach, we observe that
  resonance states along one chain are clearly correlated, while
  resonance states of different chains show an anticorrelation. Studying
  the phase-space representations of the resonance states, we find that
  their localization in phase space oscillates between different regions
  of the classical trapped set as one moves along the chains, and that
  these oscillations are connected to a modulation of the resonance
  spacing. A single resonance chain is thus not a WKB quantization of a
  single periodic orbit, but the structure of several oscillating chains
  arises from the interaction of several periodic orbits. We illuminate
  the physical mechanism behind these findings by combining the
  semiclassical cycle expansion with a quantum graph model.}

  Standard techniques for computing {Lyapunov} vectors produce

differential and algebraic {Lyapunov} equations in the time and frequency
domains. Solutions of these equations are finite and infinite Gramians.
In the first approach, we use the Laplace transform to solve the
equations, and we apply the expansion of the matrix resolvent of the
dynamical system. The expansions are bilinear and quadratic forms of the
Faddeev matrices generated by resolvents of the original matrices. The
second method allows computation of an infinite Gramian of a stable
system as a sum of sub-Gramians, which characterize the contribution of
eigenmodes to the asymptotic variation of the total system energy over an
infinite time interval. Because each sub-Gramian is associated with a
particular eigenvector, the potential sources of instability can easily
be localized and tracked in real time. When solutions of {Lyapunov} equations have low-rank structure typical of large-scale applications,
sub-Gramians can be represented in low-rank factored form, which makes
them convenient in the stability analysis of large systems. Our numerical
tests for Kundur's four-machine two-area system confirm the suitability
of using Gramians and sub-Gramians for small-signal stability analyses of
electric power systems.}

    Lyapunov vectors (OLVs), are currently used to characterize the linear
    stability of chaotic systems. A comparison is made to show their
    similarity and difference, especially with respect to the influence
    on hydrodynamic Lyapunov modes (HLMs). Our numerical simulations
    show that in both Hamiltonian and dissipative systems HLMs formerly
    detected via OLVs survive if CLVs are used instead. Moreover, the
    previous classification of two universality classes works for CLVs
    as well, i.e., the dispersion relation is linear for Hamiltonian
    systems and quadratic for dissipative systems, respectively. The
    significance of HLMs changes in different ways for Hamiltonian and
    dissipative systems with the replacement of OLVs with CLVs. For general
    dissipative systems with nonhyperbolic dynamics the long-wavelength
    structure in Lyapunov vectors corresponding to near-zero Lyapunov
    exponents is strongly reduced if CLVs are used instead, whereas for
    highly hyperbolic dissipative systems the significance of HLMs is
    nearly identical for CLVs and OLVs. In contrast the HLM significance
    of Hamiltonian systems is always comparable for CLVs and OLVs irrespective
    of hyperbolicity. We also find that in Hamiltonian systems different
    symmetry relations between conjugate pairs are observed for CLVs
    and OLVs. Especially, CLVs in a conjugate pair are statistically
    indistinguishable in consequence of the microreversibility of Hamiltonian
    systems. Transformation properties of Lyapunov exponents, CLVs, and
    hyperbolicity under changes of coordinate are discussed in appendices.}

  abstract =  {The complex interactions between spatial and temporal
                 components of the dynamics, known as spatiotemporal
                 chaos, only recently begun to be studied using ideas
                 from fundamental dynamical systems theory (Temam, 1988;
                 Goren et al. 1995; Christiansen et al. 1997). The
                 present dissertation is primarily interested in
                 studying the appearance of global bifurcations in two
                 specific physical examples, a laser with an injected
                 signal, and a catalytic reaction on a platinum surface.
                 Characteristic of these bifurcations is the presence of
                 a highly degenerate .... One of the main motivations to
                 study these equations is that some of them display
                 spatiotemporal chaos, which in many ways, resembles
                 turbulence in fluid dynamics. Recently, different
                 efforts to uncover the dynamical origin for these
                 complex states have been developing (Goren et al. 1995;
                 Christiansen et al. 1997).},
