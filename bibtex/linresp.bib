  abstract={The use of linear response theory for forced dissipative
  stochastic dynamical systems through the fluctuation dissipation
  theorem is an attractive way to study climate change systematically
  among other applications. Here, a mathematically rigorous justification
  of linear response theory for forced dissipative stochastic dynamical
  systems is developed. The main results are formulated in an abstract
  setting and apply to suitable systems, in finite and infinite
  dimensions, that are of interest in climate change science and other
  applications.}

linear response formula for the variation of an expectation value at time
t under a time-dependent infinitesimal perturbation δτF of the acting
forces. This leads to a form of the fluctuation-dissipation theorem valid
far from equilibrium: the complex singularities of the susceptibility are
in part those of the spectral density, and in part of a different nature
to be discussed. "

  abstract={Using Sinai - Ruelle - Bowen measures to describe
  nonequilibrium steady states, one can in principle compute the

  be done in practice, and how the results correspond to the zero noise
  limit when there is a stochastic perturbation. The approach used is
  formal rather than rigorous.}
