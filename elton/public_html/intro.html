<h2>Introduction to the World Wide Web (WWW) and the 
Hyper Text Markup Language (HTML)</h2> 
(Part of this page was contributed by
    <a href="http://www.astro.ku.dk/~milvang/">Bo Milvang-Jensen</a>)


<h3>This page provides background information for creating a
WWW personal (home) page.</h3>

<h4>Some basic concepts:</h4>
<dl>
    <dt>WWW (World Wide Web):
    <dd>The World Wide Web may be defined loosely as the collection of
        network-accessible information. This information need not only be
        plain text, but may also be <i>hypertext</i>, graphics, sounds,
        and movies. The WWW project was initiated at CERN in 1989.
    <dt>WWW browser:
    <dd>To access the WWW, you need a WWW browser. On UNIX machines, two
        possibilities are "Mosaic" and "Netscape".  Some strongly recommend
        "Netscape", which is (at least subjectively) much faster than
        "Mosaic".
    <dt>hypertext and hyperlinks:
    <dd>Hypertext differs from plain text in that it offers the possibility
        to place so called hyperlinks to other documents (which may be
        plain text, hypertext, graphics, sounds, etc.) in the document,
        allowing the reader to decide how to navigate. <br>
        This document that you a reading right now is a hypertext document,
        and you could try following a hyperlink to
        <a href="http://info.cern.ch/">CERN</a> by single-clicking on the
        underlined/colored word (here "CERN").  Before you do, be sure to
        locate the button marked "Back" (near the top in "Netscape", near
        the bottom in "Mosaic").
    <dt>HTML (HyperText Markup Language):
    <dd>Hypertext placed on the WWW is written in HTML. HTML is analogous
        to LaTeX in that you have on the one hand source code, which
        includes special commands (in LaTeX these would begin by a
        backslash, in HTML you use &lt;, &gt;, and &amp;), and on the
        other hand the formatted output. <br>
        When you are browsing the WWW (using your favorite WWW browser),
        you may always view the HTML source code for the hypertext
        document you come across -- in Mosaic, chose "View Source" from
        the "File" menu; in Netscape, chose "Source..." from the "View"
        menu. Try it on this document! <br>
        To learn more, you could consult
        <a href="http://www.ncsa.uiuc.edu/General/Internet/WWW/HTMLPrimer.html">
        A Beginner's Guide to HTM</a>.
    <dt>URL (Uniform Resource Locator)
    <dd>To access information on the WWW, one needs to know where it is, so to
        speak. If your WWW browser is Mosaic, it will display the URL of the
        page you are currently at in the 'window' named "Document URL".
        If your WWW browser is Netscape, it will display the URL in the "window"
        named "Location", if you have chosen "Show Location" from the "Options"
        menu.<br>
        In the beginning, you need not worry too much about URLs -- but what they
        specify is:
        <ul>
            <li>The method of access (e.g. <code>http</code> --
                HyperText Transfer Protocol)
            <li>The Internet address (e.g. <code>www.astro.ku.dk</code>)
            <li>The TCP port number (default is 80 for HTTP)
            <li>The path- and filename
        </ul>

<h2>If you want an easy homepage
<dd>Copy the files from ~wwwcats/Web/HOME_EXAMPLE 
<dd>to a directory named
WWW under you homedirectory.<p>
i.e.<p>
<code>cd;mkdir WWW;cp -rp ~wwwcats/Web/HOME_EXAMPLE/* WWW</code>

</h2>
<ol>
    <li>If you did, you now have the following files and directories:
        <dl>
            <dt><code>Welcome.html</code>
            <dd>This file contains the first information people
                will get about you -- i.e. the presentation of you
                at a glance. As all files with extension <code>.html</code>,
                it is written in HTML.
            <dt><code>portrait.gif</code>
            <dd>This file should contain a picture of you, in GIF format. Right
                now it doesn't and you can easily identify the link to it in your
                Welcome.html file and then remove it.
            <dt><code>papers</code>
            <dd>This directory should contain the papers you want to
                show to the world -- either as actual files placed in this
                directory or as (symbolic) links to where you have your
                paper files. Your papers could for example be in
                PostScript.
            <dt><code>teaching</code>
            <dd>This is the directory where you can put (links to) lecture 
                notes. Either update <code>links/Welcome.html</code>to include
                the appropiate links or remove the file, in which case, 
                selecting teaching on you homepage will show the contents of
                that directory.                
            <dt><code>links.html</code>
            <dd>This file is where you may put hyperlinks to other sites you
                would like to recommend.
            <dt><code>html-quick-guide.txt</code>
            <dd>This is a plain textfile with information about html. 
        <p>
    </dl>
    <li>You may now look at your (still template) personal/home WWW page
        using your favorite WWW browser.
        You may tell your WWW browser to access your file as a local
	file in the UNIX filesystem; e.g.,
	<blockquote>
	<code>netscape ~/WWW/Welcome.html &</code><p>or<p>
	<code>mosaic ~/WWW/Welcome.html &</code>
	</blockquote>
	This has the advantage that you can still access the links to
	these instructions.<p>
	You may also use the URL the rest of
        the WWW will have to use when accessing your personal/home page.
        Remember, if your username is, say, <code>georg</code>, your URL
        will be <code>http://www.nbi.dk/~georg/</code>.  Normally, this
        page will be accessed through the NBI home page, but you
        may choose to make other, similar files accessible in the same
        directory.  Any WWW user may access the files in your <code>
	~/WWW/</code> directory directly, if they wish.
        <dl>
            <dt>NCSA Mosaic:
            <dd>Chose "Open URL..." from the "File" menu, or press ALT-O,
                and enter your URL.
                When you later on edit your files, you will need to tell
                Mosaic to reload the page, which is done by choosing
                "Reload Current" from the "File" menu, or by pressing ALT-R.
            <dt>Netscape:
            <dd>Chose "Open Location" from the "File" menu, or press ALT-L,
                and enter your URL.
                When you later on edit your files, you will need to tell
                Netscape to reload the page, which is done by choosing
                "Reload" from the "View" menu, or by pressing ALT-R.
        </dl>
    <li>You now need to edit the template files as follows (remember to reload
        when you want to see the changes):
        <dl>
            <dt><code>Welcome.html</code>
            <dd>Change all generic information to specific information
                pertinent to you.<br>
                Remove the reference to this page when you no longer need it.
            <dt><code>portrait.gif</code>
            <dd>Replace this template picture with a picture of yourself (still in GIF format) 
            or remove the link.
            <dt><code>papers</code>
            <dd>Remove the links in this directory and link in your own
                reprints and preprints.
            <dt><code>papers.html</code>
            <dd>Update this file (as a minimum keep the table or the
                directory). Alternatively, remove the papers directory all
                together and replace it with a link to another directory with
                your <code>.ps</code> files.
            <dt><code>links.html</code>
            <dd>Either update this file, or remove the reference to it from
                your personal/home page.
            <dt>When linking to files not in  your WWW directory (instead of
            copying them) you should make sure that the protections are right.
