dynamical systems to study the breakup of invariant curves. Slater's
theorem states that an irrational translation over a circle returns to an
arbitrary interval in at most three different recurrence times
expressible by the continued fraction expansion of the related irrational
number. The hypothesis considered in this paper is that Slater's theorem
can be also verified in the dynamics of invariant curves. Hence, we use
Slater's theorem to develop a qualitative and quantitative numerical
approach to determine the breakup of invariant curves in the phase space
of area-preserving maps.},

  Abstract                 = {The method we present in this paper uses trajectory averages of scalar
    functions on the state space to: (a) identify invariant sets in the
    state space, and (b) to form coherent structures by aggregating invariant
    sets that are similar across multiple spatial scales. First, we construct
    the ergodic quotient, the object obtained by mapping trajectories
    to the space of the trajectory averages of a function basis on the
    state space. Second, we endow the ergodic quotient with a metric
    structure that successfully captures how similar the invariant sets
    are in the state space. Finally, we parametrize the ergodic quotient
    using intrinsic diffusion modes on it. By segmenting the ergodic
    quotient based on the diffusion modes, we extract coherent features
    in the state space of the dynamical system. The algorithm is validated
    by analyzing the Arnold-Beltrami-Childress flow, which was the test-bed
    for alternative approaches: the Ulam's approximation of the transfer
    operator and the computation of Lagrangian Coherent Structures. Furthermore,
    we explain how the method extends the Poincar\'e map analysis for
    periodic flows. As a demonstration, we apply the method to a periodically-driven
    three-dimensional Hill's vortex flow, discovering unknown coherent
    structures in its state space.},

                 stability of inviscid parallel flows, both for
                 homogeneous and for stratified fluids. The usefulness
                 of these bounds, as compared with that of previous
                 results, is assessed for several examples. For
                 homogeneous fluids the new upper bounds for the
                 imaginary part ci of the complex phase velocity are
                 sometimes better than previous criteria. For both
                 homogeneous and stratified flows, the new upper bounds
                 for the wave-number ? of neutrally stable disturbances
                 improve on previous results, giving values within 10%
                 of the known exact solution in several cases.}

                 rates of strain, is here adapted to incorporate the
                 contribution of various types of body force. In the
                 absence of body forces, it is known that unbounded
                 flows with constant vorticity and elliptical
                 streamlines are unstable to certain planar
                 disturbances, which are amplified by a Floquet
                 mechanism. The influence of a Coriolis force upon this
                 instability mechanism is here described in detail, as
                 an illustration of the general formulation. The results
                 are likely to be of geophysical interest and may also
                 have relevance to the breakdown of closed-eddy
                 structures in turbulence. The final section of the

                 solutions may be obtained.}

                 aim of better understanding the mechanism of flow
                 transition from laminar flow to turbulent flow. In this
                 theory, it is suggested that the transition to
                 turbulence depends on the relative magnitudes of the
                 energy gradient amplifying the disturbance and the
                 viscous friction damping that disturbance. For a given
                 flow geometry and fluid properties, when the maximum of
                 K (the ratio of the energy gradient in the transverse
                 direction to that in the streamwise direction) in the
                 flow field is larger than a certain critical value, it
                 is expected that instability would occur for some
                 initial disturbances. In this paper, using the energy
                 analysis, the equation for calculating K for plane
                 Couette flow is derived. It is demonstrated that the
                 critical value of K at subcritical transition is about
                 370 for plane Couette flow. This value is about the
                 same as for plane Poiseuille flow and pipe Poiseuille
                 flow (385-389). Therefore, it is concluded that the
                 critical value of K at subcritical transition is about
                 370-389 for wall bounded parallel shear flows which
                 include both pressure and shear driven flows.}

  Abstract                 = {We investigate experimentally the mixing
dynamics in a channel flow with a finite stirring region
undergoing chaotic advection. We study the homogenization of
dye in two variants of an eggbeater stirring protocol that
differ in the extent of their mixing region. In the first case,
the mixing region is separated from the side walls of the
channel, while in the second it extends to the walls. For the
first case, we observe the onset of a permanent concentration
pattern that repeats over time with decaying intensity. A
quantitative analysis of the concentration field of dye
confirms the convergence to a self-similar pattern, akin to the
strange eigenmodes previously observed in closed flows. We
model this phenomenon using an idealized map, where an analysis
of the mixing dynamics explains the convergence to an
eigenmode. In contrast, for the second case the presence of
no-slip walls and separation points on the frontier of the
mixing region leads to non-self-similar mixing dynamics.}

                 through a circular straight pipe remains one of the
                 oldest problems in fluid mechanics. So far no
                 explanation has been substantiated to rationalize the
                 transition process by which the steady unidirectional
                 laminar flow state gives way to a temporally and
                 spatially disordered three-dimensional (turbulent)
                 solution as the flow rate increases. Recently, new
                 travelling wave solutions have been discovered which
                 are saddle points in phase space. These plausibly
                 represent the lowest level in a hierarchy of
                 spatio-temporal periodic flow solutions which may be
                 used to construct a cycle expansion theory of turbulent
                 pipe flows. We summarize this success against the
                 backdrop of past work and discuss its implications for
                 future research.},

  Abstract                 = {Transition to turbulence in pipe flow is one of the
                 most fundamental and longest-standing problems in fluid
                 dynamics. Stability theory suggests that the flow
                 remains laminar for all flow rates, but in practice
                 pipe flow becomes turbulent even at moderate speeds.
                 This transition drastically affects the transport
                 efficiency of mass, momentum, and heat. On the basis of
                 the recent discovery of unstable traveling waves in
                 computational studies of the Navier-Stokes equations
                 and ideas from dynamical systems theory, a model for
                 the transition process has been suggested. We report
                 experimental observation of these traveling waves in
                 pipe flow, confirming the proposed transition scenario
                 and suggesting that the dynamics associated with these
                 unstable states may indeed capture the nature of fluid
                 turbulence.}

                 appear with lifetimes longer than the viscous one.
                 Depending on the type of the perturbation, isolated
                 initial conditions with infinite lifetime appear for
                 Reynolds numbers larger than about 270–305. In this
                 third regime, the lifetime as a function of Reynolds
                 number and amplitude is fractal. These results suggest
                 that in the transition region the turbulent dynamics is
                 characterized by a chaotic repeller rather than an
                 attractor.},

    standard capillary number used to describe this process is inadequate
    since it does not account for advection of a drop between regions of
    the flow with varying velocity gradient. Consequently, we propose a
    Lagrangian-generalized capillary number CL number based on
    finite-time Lyapunov exponents. We present preliminary tests of this
    formalism for the stretching of a single drop of oil in an
    oscillating vortex flow, which has been shown previously to exhibit
    Lagrangian chaos. Probability distribution functions (PDFs) of the
    stretching of this drop have features that are similar to PDFs of CL.
    We also discuss on-going experiments that we have begun on drop
    stretching in a blinking vortex flow. PACS: 47.52.+j; 47.55.Dz; 94.10.Lf},

                 Gaussian. In the intermediate scales, the dynamics is
                 reminiscent of travelling waves and heteroclinic cyces
                 which is the typical behavior for small system size. In
                 the small scales, the dynamics is intermittent. Through
                 investigation of the interaction between different
                 scales, we see the intermediate structures give the
                 defining shape of the cell and the large scales trigger
                 the spatiotemporal chaos. The small scales dissipate
                 energy and modify the background in a average sense.}
