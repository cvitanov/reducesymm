\maketitle
Given a dynamical system with a continuous symmetry, we construct a
perturbed system whose trajectories converge
to the invariant
solutions of the original dynamical system. The perturbation term is
a measure of the curvature of the trajectories and is readily computable from
the equations of motion. The computational cost is therefore reduced considerably
compared to algorithms based on Newton's iterations or variational methods.
