Dear Prof. Balmforth,

In this manuscript we develop a universally convergent numerical method for finding steady and traveling wave solutions of Navier—Stokes equations. Applying this method to a chaotic Kolmogorov flow, we discover several new invariant solutions. 
We thoroughly discuss the role of these new solutions on the global dynamics. 
In particular, we show that one of the newly found steady state solutions underpins the temporal intermittencies, i.e., high energy dissipation episodes of the flow. 

Over the last 10 years, there has been a growing interest in the fluid dynamics community 
to study turbulent flows (specially transitional turbulence) in terms of the invariant solutions of Navier—Stokes equations. A problem with the state-of-the-art method (i.e., Newton-GMRES-hook iterations) is that its convergence requires a good initial guess. Therefore, I believe the community will appreciate the development presented in the present manuscript. In addition, the discussion on intermittency and symmetries will be of interest to a broader audience.
