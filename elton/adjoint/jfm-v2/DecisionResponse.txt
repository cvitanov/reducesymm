JFM-15-S-0999
An adjoint-based approach for finding invariant solutions of Navier--Stokes equations
Farazmand, Mohammad



Dear Professor Balmforth,

Thank you for the handling of this manuscript. The reviewers made a number
of good comments/suggestions that improved the manuscript. I attach the
itemized response to each reviewer as a separate PDF file. 

All changes are highlighted with red color in the revised manuscript.

Also, in response to the request of Reviewer 3, I prepared an online tutorial
explaining the adjoint method on a simple model PDE. This tutorial and the
accompanying matlab codes are available at 
https://farazmand.wordpress.com/2015/12/18/adjoint/

I have added a “Supplementary material” section to the revised manuscript
(just before appendices) to refer the interested reader to this tutorial. 
I am not sure what JFM’s policy is regarding external links. Of course, 
should the manuscript be accepted for publication, I am happy to transfer
the tutorial files to the appropriate JFM server if needed. 

As I am applying for jobs this year, I would really appreciate it if you could please
ask the referees to submit their reviews as soon as they can. 

Best Regards,
Mohammad
