Authors responses to Referee 2
==============================

( The comments are given in full with author responses listed in
  parenthetical comments. The reference list is at the bottom of this
  text. The text edits are colored blue in the referee version of the
  resubmitted article. )

1. Dependence of the results on the template.
I think that the extracted results should highly depend on the template
(what kind of coherent structures the authors are going to search for).
In the paper, however, I am afraid I cannot find a discussion about
dependence of the template (what would appear from different template) or
comment on why the authors use the present template.

(
   There is no elegant solution to this problem; there is no
   justification for a template choice other that it does what it is
   supposed to do. The dependence is of the same kind that the referee is
   familiar from use of Poincare sections: any good section cuts
   transversely trajectories of interest and captures correctly their
   topological relations, even though sections chosen by different
   investigators can look very different. Our reasoning for the projection
   based on ML, which occurs at the beginning of section 5.1 has been
   extended. The projection at equation (5.1) is good for the projection
   onto paper. But this is only a projection of the sliced trajectories.
   The slicing itself can be performed using several templates, see
   figure 8b. Slicing using {\em any} individual template reduces {\em
   all} relative periodic orbits to periodic orbits, and travelling waves
   to an equilibrium point, provided that jumps do not occur in the shift
   required for the slicing. Using multiple templates helps to avoid
   jumps. Further comment has been added to the text shortly before
   section 5.2.
)

2. Compensatory norm in equation (4.3):
Why has this special norm been employed? The new solutions cannot be
obtained without this norm?

(
   The norm (4.3) was not used in the slicing projection (although it
   would be valid to do so), but only for the calculation of recurrences
   and in the Newton scheme. The reasoning and motivation for this norm
   are given just before the definition (4.3). Heuristically it was found
   to improve (or make possible) convergence in the Newton scheme. Which
   norm is used where has been made clear in the new text around (4.3).
)

3. Caption of figure 11 "the energy input at the walls" is incorrect.
"the energy input by pressure" or so would be correct.

(
   Thank you for this correction. The text has been edited accordingly.
)


Referee minor comments:
=======================

4. Kawahara & Kida 2005 This might have been Kawahara & Kida 2001 (JFM
449, 291-300). Kawahara & Kida 2005 is written in Japanese!

(
   Thank you :-) This has been changed to Kawahara & Kida 2001.
)

5. Equation (2.2) "m" should not appear?

(
   m is the azimuthal rotation symmetry so that for e.g. m=3 the sum runs
   over Fourier modes m'=0,3,6,9... The text immediately following (2.2)
   has been altered to help clarify.
)

6. Figure 6 (a) I cannot see the red dashed curve (red solid?)

(
   The figure caption has been corrected.
)
