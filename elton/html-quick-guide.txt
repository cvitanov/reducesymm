HTML Quick Reference

HTML is composed of a set of elements that define a document and guide its
display. An HTML element may include a name, some attributes and some text or
hypertext, and will appear in an HTML document as

   <tag_name> text </tag_name> 
   <tag_name attribute_name=argument> text </tag_name>, or just 
   <tag_name> 

For example:

   <title> My Useful Document </title>

and

   <a href="argument"> text </a>

An HTML document is composed of a single element:

   <html> . . . </html>

that is, in turn, composed of head and body elements:

   <head> . . . </head>

and 

   <body> . . . </body>

To allow older HTML documents to remain readable, <html>, <head>, and <body>
are actually optional within HTML documents. 

Elements usually placed in the head element

<isindex>
   Specify index file 
<title> . . . </title> 
   Specify document title 
<nextid>
   Set a variable value. Attribute: variable name 
<link>
   Specify relationships to other documents. Attributes: same as Anchor below 
<base>
   Specify the name of the file in which the current document is stored. This
   is useful when link references within the document do not include full
   pathnames (i.e., are partially qualified). 

Elements usually placed in the body element

The following sections describe elements that can be used in the body of the
document.

Text Elements

<p>
   The end of a paragraph that will be formatted before it is displayed on the
   screen. 
<pre> . . . </pre> 
   Identifies text that has already been formatted (preformatted) by some other
   system and must be displayed as is. Preformatted text may include embedded
   tags, but not all tag types are permitted. 
<listing> . . . </listing> 
   Example computer listing; embedded tags will be ignored, but embedded tabs
   will work 
<plaintext>
<blockquote> . . . </blockquote> 
   Include a section of text quoted from some other source. 

Hyperlinks or Anchors

<a name="target_anchor_name"> . . . </a>
   Define a target location in a document 
<a href="#anchor_name"> . . . </a>
   Link to a location in the same file 
<a href="URL"> . . . </a>
   Link to another file 
<a href="URL#target_string"> . . . </a>
   Link to a target location in another file 
<a href="URL?search_word+search_word"> . . . </a>
   Send a search string to a server. Different servers might interpret the
   search string differently. In the case of word oriented search engines,
   multiple search words might be specified by separating individual words with
   a plus sign (+). 

Required attributes for anchors: one of name or href.

Optional attributes: rel, rev, urn, title, methods. Note that not all methods
are valid attributes to an anchor.

The structure of a Universal Resource Locator (URL) is similar to: 

   resource_type://host.domain:port/pathname 

where the possible resource types include: file, http, news, gopher, telnet,
and wais, and the colon followed by the TCP port number is optional. A more
complete description is presented in

The <dl> attribute compact can be used to generate a definition list requiring
less space.

Present an unordered list: <ul>

<ul>
<li> First item in the list
<li> Next item in the list
</ul>

Present an ordered list: <ol>

<ol>
<li> First item in the list

<menu>
<li> First item in the menu
<li> Next item
</menu>

Present a directory list of items: <dir>

<dir>
<li> First item in the list
<li> Second item in the list
<li> Next item in the list
</dir>

Items should be less than 20 characters long.

Entities

&keyword;
   Display a particular character identified by a special keyword. For example
   the entity &amp; specifies the ampersand ( & ), and the entity &lt;
   specifies the less than ( < ) character. Note that the semicolon following
   the keyword is required, and the keyword must be one from the list presented
   in: 
   http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/MarkUp/Entities.html 
   -or- 
   The ISO LATIN I character set 
&#ascii_equivalent;
   Use a character literally. Again note that the semicolon following the ASCII
   numeric value is required. 

HTML Forms Interface

The HTML forms interface allows document creators to define HTML documents
containing forms to be filled out by users. When a user fills out the form and
presses a button indicating the form should be "submitted," the information on
the form is sent to a server for processing. The server will usually prepare an
HTML document using the information supplied by the user and return it to the
client for display. 

The following tags implement the forms interface: 

   <form> . . . </form> 
   <input> 
   <select> . . . </select> 
   <option> 
   <textarea> . . . </textarea> 

The last four tags can only be used within a <form> . . . </form> element. 

<form> . . . </form> 

ATTRIBUTES: action, method 
ARGUMENTS for: 

   action: The URL of the query server similar to:
      <form action="URL"> . . . </form> 
   method: One of get or post similar to:
      <form action="URL" method=post> . . . </form> 

<input> (there is no ending tag) 
   Defines an input field where the user may enter information on the form. 

   ATTRIBUTES: type, name, value, checked, size, maxlength 
   ARGUMENTS for: 

      type: 
         One of: "text", "password", "checkbox", "radio", "submit", or "reset" 

         type="text" and type="password" accept character data; type="checkbox"
         is either selected or not; type="radio" allows selection of one of
         several options; type="submit" is an action button that sends the
         completed form to the query server; type="reset" is a button that
         resets the applicable default values in the form. 
      name: 
         "textstring" where textstring is a symbolic name (not displayed)
         identifying the input field as in: 
         <input type="checkbox" name="box1"> 
      value: 
         "textstring" where the function of textstring depends on the argument
         for type. 

            For type="text" or type="password", textstring is the default value
            for the input field. 
            If type="checkbox" or type="radio", textstring is the value of 
            input when it is selected. 
            For type="reset" or type="submit", textstring is a label for the 
            input field. 
      checked: 
         No arguments. For type="checkbox" or type="radio", if checked is
         present the input field is selected by default. 
      size: 
         width or width, height where width and height are integer values
         representing the number of characters by number of lines for the 
         type="text" or type="password" input fields. 
      maxlength: 
         length where length is the number of characters accepted for 
         type="text" or type="password". This attribute is only valid for
         single line "text" or "password" fields. 

<select> . . . </select> 
   defines a list of options the user can select for the field. This element
   employs the <option> element for each item in the list. 

   ATTRIBUTES: name, size, multiple 
   ARGUMENTS for: 

      name: 
         "textstring" where textstring is the symbolic identifier for the 
         select field. 
      size: 
         The argument for size is an integer value representing the number of 
         <option> items that will be displayed at one time. 
      multiple: 
         No arguments. If present, the multiple attribute allows selection of
         more than one <option>. 

<option> 
   Within the <select> element the <option> tags are used to define the
   possible values for the select field as in: 

   <select>
   <option>textstring 1
   <option>textstring 2
   <option>textstring 3
   </select> 

   textstring 1, textstring 2, and textstring 3 represent possible values of
   the select field. 

   ATTRIBUTES: selected 
   ARGUMENTS for: 

      selected: 
         No arguments. If selected is present then the option is selected by
         default. 

<textarea> . . . default text . . . </textarea> 

Defines a rectangular field where the user may enter text data. If "default
text" is present it will be displayed when the field appears. Otherwise the
field will be blank. 

ATTRIBUTES: name, rows, cols 
ARGUMENTS for: 

   name 
      "textstring" where textstring is a symbolic name that identifies the 
      <textarea> field. 
   rows and cols: 
      Both attributes take an integer value which represents the lines and
      number of characters per line in the <textarea> to be displayed. 

Miscellaneous

<!-- text -->
   Place a comment in the HTML source 
<address> . . . </address>
   Present address information 
<img src="URL" alt="Alternate Text">
   Include a graphic image. "URL" is the location and filename of the image
   file. The alt attribute allows a text string to be put in place of the image
   in clients that cannot display images.

   Other possible attributes are: ismap and align.

   The argument for align can be one of top, middle, or bottom. 
<br> 
   Forces a line break immediately and retains the same style. 
<hr> 
   Places a horizontal rule or separator between sections of text. 
<link rev="RELATIONSHIP" rel="RELATIONSHIP" href="URL"> 
   The link tag allows you to define a relation ship between the "URL"
   specified and the HTML file. The rel attribute specifies the relationship
   between the HTML file and the "URL". The rev attribute specifies the
   relationship between the "URL" and the HTML file. The only currently
   implemented link relation ship is rev="made". 

   <link rev="made" href="URL"> 

   allows the file maker or owner to be specified in the link "URL". The most
   common use of this is as follows: 

      <link rev="made" href="mailto:EMAIL_ADDRESS@HOST">
