This paper explores the dynamics of Lagrangian tracer particles within 
time-invariant solutions of the Navier-Stokes equations in three-dimensional 
plane Couette flow. Viewing the Eulerian velocity field of an invariant solution 
as a dynamical system, the transport of these passive scalars along Lagrangian 
flow trajectories reveals a rich repertoire of different types of motion that 
can occur. These include stagnation points, for which there is no fluid movement, 
and invariant tori, which obstruct chaotic mixing across the full volume of the 
plane Couette flow minimal cell. We determine the stability of these stagnation 
points, along with their stable and unstable manifolds, and find heteroclinic 
connections between them. These topological features found in time-invariant
Eulerian flows produce a skeleton that shapes the passive tracer flow for 
general turbulent fluid flow. This provides a first step to a new program elucidating 
Lagrangian particle transport and mixing as a walk between different regions in
the Eulerian state space.
