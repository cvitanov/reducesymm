Turbulence is a ubiquitous phenomena. It was first observed in the fluid
motion\rf{frisch}
and more recently in the chemical reactions, optics, coupled oscillators
and so on\rf{cvt89b,hao90b}.


The claim explored in this
article is that periodic orbit theory is a candidate for a
dynamical theory of turbulence. It has been
applied to many low-dimensional chaotic systems with remarkable success.
