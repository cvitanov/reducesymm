We undertake an exploration of Lagrangian mixing in
recurrent patterns in the

For a small, but already rather ``turbulent'' system,
the long-time dynamics takes place on a low-dimensional
invariant manifold. A set of equilibria offers a coarse
geometrical partition of this manifold.

 The mixing
dynamics appears decomposable into chaotic dynamics within such
local repellers, interspersed by rapid jumps between them.
