\begin{abstract}
\noindent 
Tracer particle trajectories for equilibrium solutions of the Navier-Stokes equations confined to a planar geometry are studied. A given equilibrium velocity field may be treated as a dynamical system, and by analyzing the behavior of flow trajectories within the velocity field, we uncover special features where there is no fluid movement as well as heteroclinic connections between these points of stagnation. These topological features provide a Lagrangian skeleton of the flow dynamics that may be used as a first step to studying bulk fluid properties such as mixing efficiency and diffusion.

\section{Plane Couette Flow}
\label{sec:PCF}

\subsection{Symmetries of PCF}
\label{PCF_symm}

\PCf\ is invariant under two reflections $\sigma_1,\sigma_2$ and a
continuous two-parameter group of translations $\tau(\shift_x, \shift_z)$:
\begin{align}
\sigma_1 \, [u,v,w](x,y,z) &= [u, v,-w](x,y,-z) \nnu \\
\sigma_2 \, [u,v,w](x,y,z) &= [-u,-v,w](-x,-y,z)  \label{reflSfit1}\\
\tau(\shift_x, \shift_z)[u,v,w](x,y,z) &= [u,v,w](x+\shift_x,y,z+\shift_z) \nnu\,.
\end{align}
The \NSe s and boundary conditions are invariant for any symmetry $s$
in the group generated by these elements:
$\partial (s \bu) / \partial t = s (\partial \bu / \partial t)$.

The plane Couette symmetries can be interpreted geometrically in the space of
fluid velocity fields. Let $\bbU$ be the space of
square-integrable, real-valued velocity fields that satisfy the kinematic
conditions of \pCf:
\begin{align}
 \bbU  &= \{\bu \in L^2(\Omega) \; | \; \grad \cdot \bu = 0,
               \; \bu(x, \pm 1, z) = 0, \notag  \\
         &\phantom{=} {} \qquad \qquad \qquad \; \; %\text{and }
          \bu(x, y, z) = \bu(x+L_x, y, z) = \bu(x, y, z + L_z)\}  \,.
\end{align} \JRE{Shouldn't we say $\mathbf{u}= \pm 1$ at the walls for consistency?}
The continuous symmetry $\tau(\shift_x, \shift_z)$ maps each state
$\bu \in \bbU$ to a $2d$ torus of states with identical dynamic
behavior. This torus in turn is mapped to four equivalent tori by
the subgroup $\{1,\sigma_1,\sigma_2, \sigma_1 \sigma_2\}$. In
general a given state in $\bbU$ has four $2d$ tori of dynamically
equivalent states.

Most of the Eulerian \eqva\ that we know of so far
are invariant under the `shift-reflect' symmetry
$s_1 = \tau(L_x/2,0) \, \sigma_1$ and the `shift-rotate' symmetry
$s_2 = \tau(L_x/2,L_z/2) \, \sigma_2$.  These symmetries form a subgroup
$S = \{1, s_1, s_2, s_3\}$, $s_3 = s_1 s_2$, which is isomorphic to
the Abelian dihedral group $D_2$. The group acts on velocity fields
as:
\begin{align}
s_1 \, [u, v, w](x,y,z) &= [u, v, -w](x+L_x/2,\, y,\, -z) \nnu \\
s_2 \, [u, v, w](x,y,z) &= [-u, -v, w](-x+L_x/2,\,-y,\,z+L_z/2) \label{shiftRot} \\
s_3 \, [u, v, w](x,y,z) &= [-u,-v,-w](-x,\, -y,\, -z+L_z/2) \nnu \,.
\end{align}

Consider next the subgroup $S_3 = \{1,s_3\} \subset S$ (isomorphic to
dihedral group $D_1$). The $s_3$ operation flips both the streamwise
$x$ and the spanwise $z$, thus eliminating invariance under both $x$
and $z$ continuous translations. \PC{do we need this in this paper?:
\\ ``$s_3 \bu = \bu$ implies $[u,v,w](x,y,z) =
[-u,-v,-w](-x,-y,-z+L_z/2)$, which requires $\bu = 0$ at four points
$(x,y,z) = (0,0,L_z/4); (0,0,3L_z/4); (L_x/2,0,L_z/4);
(L_x/2,0,3L_z/4)$. '' }


Let $\bbU$ be the space of square-integrable, real-valued velocity
fields that satisfy the kinematic conditions of \pCf:
\begin{align}
 \bbU  &= \{\bu \in L^2(\bCell) \; | \; \grad \cdot \bu = 0,
               \; \bu(x, \pm 1, z) = 0, \notag \\
         &\phantom{=} {} \qquad \qquad \qquad \; \; %\text{and }
          \bu(x, y, z) = \bu(x+L_x, y, z) = \bu(x, y, z + L_z)\}
\,.
\end{align}
We denote the $S$-invariant subspace of states invariant under
symmetries \refeq{shiftRot} by
\begin{align}
\bbUsymm  &= \{\bu \in \bbU  \: | \;
              s_j \bu = \bu\,, \;\;  s_j \in S \}
              % \bu = \frac{1}{4} (1 + s_1 + s_2 + s_3)\,\bu \}
\,,
\label{symmSubspU}
\end{align}
and the $S_3$-invariant subspace by
\begin{align}
\bbUthree  &= \{\bu \in \bbU  \: | \;
              s_3 \bu = \bu\,, \;\; % s_3 \in S_3\,, \;\;
              s_1 \bu \neq \bu\,, \;\;  s_2 \bu \neq \bu
               \}
\,,
\label{symmUthree}
\end{align}
where $ \bbUsymm \subset \bbUthree \subset \bbU$.
%
$\bbUsymm$ and  $\bbUthree$ are flow-invariant subspaces: states initiated
in either remain within it under the Navier-Stokes dynamics.
%     \PC{recheck this claim, please}

Idempotency of $s_3$ leads to projection operators
\beq
{\PP}_+ =
   \frac{1}{2} (\matId + s_3) \, ,\qquad
{\PP}_- =
   \frac{1}{2} (\matId - s_3) \,.
\ee{S3project}

Translations of half the cell length in the spanwise and/or streamwise
directions commute with $S$. These operators generate a discrete
subgroup of the continuous translational symmetry group $SO(2) \times
SO(2)$ :
\beq
T = \{e,\tau_x,\tau_z,\tau_{xz}\}
    \,,\qquad
    \tau_x = \tau(L_x/2,0)
    \,,\;
    \tau_z = \tau(0,L_z/2)
    \,,\;
    \tau_{xz} = \tau_x \tau_z
\,.
\ee{tauD2}
Since the action of $T$ commutes with that of $S$,
% the $T$-group orbit of each velocity field $\bu \in \bbUsymm$
% is also contained in $\bbUsymm$.
% More explicitly:
the three half-cell translations $\tau_x \bu, \, \tau_z \bu,$ and
$\tau_{xz} \bu$ of $\bu \in \bbUsymm$ are also in $\bbUsymm$.
Similarly, $\tau_{xz}$ commutes with $S_3$, so $S_3$-invariant
solutions appear in eight copies.

\section{Lagrangian Dynamics}
\label{sec:intro}

\subsection{Symmetry and Stagnation Points}
\noindent {\bf JH  April 28, 2008}:
From the form of $s_3$, we can see that any Eulerian $\eqv$ that
is invariant under has 4 Lagrangian \stagp s
which satisfy the condition:
\begin{equation}
 (x,y,z) = (-x, -y, -z+L_z / 2) \label{shiftRot_eqva}
\end{equation}
There are 4 points which satisfy this constraint:
\bea
  \xSP{1} &=& (L_x/2,0,L_z/4) \continue
  \xSP{2} &=& (L_x/2,0,3L_z/4) \continue
  \xSP{3} &=& (0,0,L_z/4) \label{s3lagrange} \\
  \xSP{4} &=& (0,0,3L_z/4) \nnu
 \,.
\eea
Due to the periodic boundary conditions
 $(L_x,0,L_z/4)=\tSP{3}$ and $(L_x,0,3L_z/4)=\tSP{4}$.
Also of note is the fact that there can exist no $s_3$-invariant \reqva, since
$s_3$ operation flips both the $x$ and $z$ axes.


\subsection{More \stagp\ arguments}
\label{arg}

\medskip\noindent {\bf  JRE July 26, 2008}:
Looking at the way the plane Couette symmetries act on velocity
fields
\begin{align}
\sigma_1 \, [u,v,w](x,y,z) &= [u, v,-w](x,y,-z) \nnu \\
\sigma_2 \, [u,v,w](x,y,z) &= [-u,-v,w](-x,-y,z)  \label{reflSfit}\\
\tau(\shift_x, \shift_z)[u,v,w](x,y,z) &=
[u,v,w](x+\shift_x,y,z+\shift_z) \nnu\,.
\end{align}
we see that, since $\tau$ does not affect the velocity components,
the \stagp s argument will work only for the combinations of these
elements which contain both $\sigma_{1}$ and $\sigma_{2}$ an odd
number of times. Let us restrict ourselves to the plane Couette
symmetries $\sigma_{1}$, $\sigma_{2}$, $\tau_{x}= \tau(L_{x}/2,0)$,
$\tau_{z}=\tau(0,L_{z}/2)$ which generate a group of order 16. In
this simplified Abelian case the requirement that permits the
argument is just to have a $\sigma_{1}\sigma_{2}$ term.  For this
case we can write down exactly which elements permit the arguments,
and the \stagp s they produce.

There are four elements of this group that contain a
$\sigma_{1}\sigma_{2}$ term. These are $g_1 = \sigma_{1}\sigma_{2}$,
$g_2 = \sigma_{1}\sigma_{2}\tau_{x}$, $g_3 =
\sigma_{1}\sigma_{2}\tau_{z}$, and $g_4 = \sigma_{1}\sigma_{2}\tau_x
\tau_z$. \JRE{I don't mean to try and introduce this as any kind of
permanent notation, I just needed some way to write them down for
now}
\begin{align}
g_1 \, [u,v,w](x,y,z) &= [-u,-v,-w](-x,-y,-z)  \\
g_2 \, [u,v,w](x,y,z) &= [-u,-v,-w](-x+L_{x}/2,-y,-z)  \\
g_3 \, [u,v,w](x,y,z) &= [-u,-v,-w](-x,-y,-z+L_{z}/2)  \\
g_2 \, [u,v,w](x,y,z) &= [-u,-v,-w](-x+L_{x}/2,-y,-z+L_{z}/2)
\end{align}

Each $g$ in turn produces four symmetrically located \stagp s in the
$y = 0$ plane. Note that $g_2$ and $g_3$ are the ones which have
already been discussed in \refsect{JHsec:4/28} and
\refsect{sect:EQ8}.

 $g_1$ symmetry implies that there are \stagp s at $(0,0,0)$, $(L_{x}/2,0,0)$, $(0,0,L_{z}/2)$, and
$(L_{x}/2,0,L_{z}/2)$. $g_2$ symmetry implies that there are \stagp
s at $(L_{x}/4,0,0)$, $(3L_{x}/4,0,0)$, $(L_{x}/4,0,L_{z}/2)$, and
$(3L_{x}/4,0,L_{z}/2)$. $g_3$ symmetry implies that there are \stagp
s at $(L_{x}/2,0,L_{z}/4)$, $(L_{x}/2,0,3L_{z}/4)$, $(0,0,L_{z}/4)$,
and $(0,0,3L_{z}/4)$. Finally $g_4$ symmetry implies that there are
\stagp s at $(L_{x}/4,0,L_{z}/4)$, $(L_{x}/4,0,3L_{z}/4)$,
$(3L_{x}/4,0,L_{z}/4)$, and $(3L_{x}/4,0,3L_{z}/4)$. These sets of
points are shown in \reffig{eltonFig:stags7_26}.

So the question of \stagp s for a given equilibrium is, which of the
$g$ symmetries do you possess? This is a question related to
invariance under the isotropy subgroups. Remember, this doesn't
address the question of whether other \stagp s may exist, simply
that these do or do not. For the known equilibria EQ1 - EQ11 all of
them have $g3$ symmetry and EQ7, EQ8 additionally have $g2$ symmetry
and that's it. Presumably this is just because searches for
equilibria were done in a symmetric subspace which contained the
$g3$ element (the $S$-symmetric subspace as it was called earlier).
If equilibria are found in other subspaces that contain more $g$'s
they will have the corresponding \stagp s.

   possessed, the velocity field will have \stagp s of the color
   corresponding to that $g$.
