Important Data files produced spring 07: 


Folders basis1, basis2, and UBbasis are the basis sets used for projection of flowfields
  basis1 and basis2 correspond to fields u1 and u2
  UBbasis is the Upper Branch basis I grabbed from PCF-data in Gibson's files 


Most importantly,
  All of the ASC files are the projections of the flowfields onto the various basis sets
  These are what is loaded into matlab to produce the plots
  These files are the place to start for investigating the funny phase space regions
  The folder UBefs contains all of the ASC files starting from the Upper Branch equilibrium
  Plots of these can be seen in Figs. 8 and 9 of my blog
  The ASC files for u1 and u2 projected on the various basis sets are scatterted throughout
  Plots can be seen in Figs. 4 and 5
