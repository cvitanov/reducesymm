\section{ZhCvGo15 flotsam}
\label{s:flotsam}

Squirrel away here potentially recyclable text from the
paper\rf{ZhCvGo15} proper, \texttt{diffuse/ZhCvGo15.tex}

remember to cite Cvitanovi\'c and Eckhardt\rf{CvitaEckardt} {\em Symmetry
decomposition of chaotic dynamics}

A test of hyperlinking: what looks better?

As a billiard built up completely of concave surfaces and as a pure
hyperbolic system, the Lorentz gas is a good candidate for description in
terms of cycle expansions\rf{AACI}.

\refRef{solomon1994chaotic} {\em Chaotic advection in a two-dimensional
flow: L\'evy flights and anomalous diffusion} studies chaotic transport
experimentally passive tracers in $2$\dmn\ rotating in laminar, chaotic,
and turbulent flows which can be described as anomolous deterministic
diffusion in periodic arrays. We do not touch that here.
