Converting eps to pdf

Now that there is a way to sync a pdf file and tex file in both
directions, the only remaining reason to use dvi files is when the
graphics are in eps format. However, that problem has also been
solved for those using Mik�TeX 2.8 or TeXLive 2009. In Mik�TeX 2.8,
simply include the package epstopdf along with graphicx. (As noted
in the comments below, even this step is not necessary in TeXLive
2009.) Then when you use pdflatex, the eps files will be
automatically converted to pdf at compile time. (The
conversion only happens the first time you process the file, and
is skipped if there is already a pdf file with the same name.) For
example:
    \documentclass{article}
    \usepackage{graphicx,epstopdf}
    \begin{document}
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{fig1}
    \end{document}
Then even though the only graphics file available is
fig1.eps, this will still be processed ok using pdflatex or
pdftexify. On the first pass, a new file called
fig1-eps-coverted-to.pdf is created and inserted at the
appropriate place.

siminos/figSrc/matlab/Wurst01.m
    An updated version of TWand01.m. Draws 3D surface to represent group
    orbit of 01 rpo. This figured is referenced as fig:CLf01group in the
    atlas blog/paper. Comments in the code should be pretty self
    explanatory. Has some ancillary code saved with it:
    ComplexLorenzEOM.m, gCLE.m, GroupOrbit.m, and mArrow3.m, so don't go
    deleting those.

siminos/figSrc/matlab/TWand01.m
    generates a plot of one period of the 01 relative periodic orbit for
    the 5D complex Lorenz system along with the group orbit of the
    relative equilibrium TW_0 (or at least their projection in the x1,
    x2, z subspace). Comments in the code should make playing around with
    it fairly self explanatory.
    Once figure is generated in Matlab it is up to you to figure out how
    you want to export it.

Added script that applies epstopdf on all eps files
in a specified directory. Usually results in huge savings in
figure size, without loss of quality. Use it for arxiv (with
pdflatex), keep eps files for APS submission.

    I've recently started using matplotlib for visualization:
matplotlib.sourceforge.net
    It is a matlab-like python library, that can be used either
    interactively or through scripts. Excellent! Perhaps it only
    lags behind matlab and mathematica in 3D capabilities.

    I've also noticed asymptote
asymptote.sourceforge.net
    produces high-quality figures in 2D and 3D. I think it is intended
    mostly for drawing, rather than for data visualization. I haven't
    tried it.

To have latex correctly display figures with white space extending
beyond the bounding box use the option clip=true in the \includegraphics
command:

\includegraphics[width=w, clip=true]{file}

Works with the graphicx package, the same should be achieved
with use of \includegraphics* in graphics package.

                      lorenzSaddle0
                      lorenzPolar1.eps
have never worked - as can be seen in
    siminos/figSrc/lorentzWoes.pdf
(and looking at them in the book.dvi is also instructive) they
take lots of white acreage: in Fig 3.7 (a) is partially
covered, and so is the page runner at the top; in Fig 4.7 (a),
(b) are covered, and right figure covers part of the left one;
in Fig 10.8 (a) and the page runner are covered. Can you fix
that. Also, copy/edit into your thesis all Lorentz and related
stuff from dasbuch/book/book.tex; you do not have much time to
finalize the thesis, this will help a lot. If you have
documented source programs for these, I do not see where. The
closest I come is:

Author: siminos 2008-01-10  Revision: 865
  testing/flows/lorenzPolar.nb
  testing/flows/lorenz.nb
Log: Plotting Lorenz figures.

Vaggelis fix:
------------
Use:

eps2eps -dEPSCrop -dEmbedAllFonts=true file.eps corrected_file.eps

The crucial option is -dEPSCrop, -dEmbedAllFonts=true can help if
there are problems with fonts, eg mathematica fonts. The output
has to be a different file. Not sure whether the fix is universal.

figure too big?
===============
					Evangelos	30 Aug 2007

Use ImageMagick to convert eps to png:

 # convert +antialias file.eps file.png

Option +antialias will reduce number of colors used. Usually this greatly reduces size
without significant loss in quality over true-color.

Then use program bmeps ( download from bmeps.sourceforge.net/, be sure to install
all required programs including the developer versions before compiling) to generate
reduced size eps:

 # bmeps -leps3 -tpng file.png new_file.eps

Options -leps3 will generate level-3 eps. The reduction in size is anywhere from 5 to 50
times (!). On the other hand one trades scalability of both graphics and fonts.

A moderate reduction in size (by a factor of 2) of some eps figures , particularly those
create by programs such as Mathematica, can be achieved if one uses pstoedit to convert
them to fig files:

 # pstoedit -f xfig -usebbfrominput -adt file.eps file.fig

The files are then loaded to xfig and exported in eps. This procedure also fixes a problem
with some Mathematica fonts not being embedded in the mapping file of the figures (-adt option
converts non-recognized fonts to polygons).

To create a png with a transparent background, this works pretty well:

 # (cat file.eps ; echo showpage ) | gs -q -dEPSCrop -dBATCH -dNOPAUSE -sDEVICE=pngalpha -sOutputFile=file.png -f -

To get a level-3 eps with transparent background from this png use:

 # bmeps -leps3,c.i.m=y,i.m.t.l=0 -tpng  -a file.png new_file.eps

The resulting files do not always display correctly with gs.

Question: How can I use bitmapped graphics while keeping scalable fonts?

The following answer is Mathematica specific regarding the
creation of files but one should be able to use it with other
programs. It cannot be used to separate text and graphics in
already existing images, one has to export those separately:

Export three figures from Mathematica:
fig.eps: The original figure
figB.png: The part of the figure that can be bitmapped
figC.eps: The part of the figure that has to remain in vector format

Plot all of them with the same options (use function Absolute options
to get the info from the original image) and do not specify size or
resolution when exporting.

Wrap figB.png into an eps file:

 # bmeps -leps3 -tpng figB.png figB.eps

Use the original figure to obtain the correct bounding box for the eps files:

 # gs -sDEVICE=bbox -dNOPAUSE -dBATCH fig.eps

Replace the bounding box in figB.eps and figC.eps with the output of the above.
Use pstricks to superimpose the two figures. A sample fig.tex file should look like:

	\documentclass{article}
	\usepackage{graphicx}
	\usepackage{pstricks}
	\pagestyle{empty}

	\begin{document}


	\rput(0,0){\includegraphics{plDetGraphB.eps}}
	\rput(0,0){\includegraphics{plDetTextC.eps}}


	\end{document}

Then

 # latex fig.tex
 # dvips -E fig.dvi -o figNew.eps

If dvips complains about missing fonts one can convert the
missing fonts in figC.eps to curves using:

eps2eps figC.eps figCfixed.eps

or

pstoedit -f ps -adt -usebbfrominput figC.eps figCfixed.eps

and after editing the bounding box in either case use
figCfixed.eps in pstricks. This will generally result in even
smaller file size so it might be a good idea to use eps2eps
anyway with figC.eps.

 One downloads jpeg2ps

 One converts all .ps files to .jpg to make them small (so they
 aren't as sharp, but they're _much_ smaller).

 One then converts the jpgs back to .ps with jpeg2ps blah.jpg > blah.ps

 (These are jpgs with .ps 'wrappers' to make latex think they're .ps
 files.  They take up about twice the space of a jpg file, so--in
 particular--the 11 meg .ps file is a 1 meg file on the arxiv.)
