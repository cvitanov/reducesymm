\section{Symmetries imply possible existence of \rpo s}
\label{sec:SymRPO}

In a dynamical system $\dot{a} = v(a)$ with a strange
invariant set, there exist infinitely many periodic orbits
\[ f^\period{}(a) = a \]
characterized by period $\period{}$, which are dense within
the invariant set. Here $f^t$ is the flow map of the flow
$v$, \ie, $a(t) = f^t(a)$ is the solution of the flow $v$
with initial condition $a(0) = a$.

Let the dynamical system have symmetries represented by the operators
$\Sigma_{k,s}$, where $k \in {\cal K} \subset \mathbb{Z}^p$ are
parameters of discrete symmetries and $s \in {\cal S} \subset \mathbb{R}^q$
are parameters of continuous symmetries.  In other words,
\[ f^t(\Sigma_{k,s} a) = \Sigma_{k,s} f^t(a)\,. \]
In this case it is likely that, in addition to \po s, the dynamical system also
has \rpo s, characterized by the condition
\[ \Sigma_{k,s}f^\period{}(a) = a\,, \]
where, in addition to the period $\period{}$, the \rpo\ is also characterized by
the symmetry parameters $k$ and/or $s$.

In fact, if the symmetry is continuous, then it is much more likely
to find \rpo s, than it is to find exact \po s, since $s = 0$,
corresponding to the \po , is only one specific value in the
continuum of possible values of parameter $s$.

In the case of KS equation, which has continuous symmetry
$\Shift_{\shift/L}$ and discrete symmetry $\Refl$, it is possible to
find \rpo s that satisfy one of the following conditions
\[
  \Shift_{\shift/L}f^\period{}(a) = a\,,
\quad\mbox{or}\quad
  \Refl\Shift_{\shift/L}f^\period{}(a) = a\,.
\]
The first condition is satisfied by \rpo s with shift $\shift$,
while \rpo s that satisfy the second condition are exactly periodic
($\shift = 0$) with period $2\period{}$.

\section{Complex Ginzburg-Landau}
\label{sec:CGL}

\item[{\Rpo s} of the complex Ginzburg-Landau]
V. Lopez, as far as the discussion about ``drift" is concerned: In
presence of continuous symmetries (for PC, streamwise and spanwise
translations) one should be searching for {\reqva} and {\rpo s} - they
are most likely more important than the \eqva\ and spatially periodic
orbits.

I like {\rpo s} paper\rf{lop05rel} by Vanessa L{\'o}pez %\rf{lopezLink},
%        http://www.cse.uiuc.edu/$\sim$vlopez:
``\emph{Relative periodic solutions of the complex Ginzburg-Landau equation}"

% [From siads\@siam.org  Dec 22 2004]:
% willing to review this manuscript for Dwight Barkley.

A method of finding {\rpo s} for differential equations with continuous
symmetries is described and its utility demonstrated by computing {\rpo
s} for the one-dimensional complex Ginzburg-Landau equation (CGLE) with
periodic boundary conditions.  A {\rpo} is a solution that is periodic in
time, up to a transformation by an element of the equation's symmetry
group.  With the method used, {\rpo s} are represented by a space-time
Fourier series modified to include the symmetry group element and are
sought as solutions to a system of nonlinear algebraic equations for the
Fourier coefficients, group element, and time period. {\Rpo s} found for
the CGLE exhibit a wide variety of temporal dynamics,
with the % sum of their positive Lyapunov exponents varying from 5.19 to
% 60.35 and their
unstable dimensions from 3 to 8.

\item[2004-09-15 Predrag]
All of your {\Rpo s} have many unstable eigendirections. Do you know that
there exist no other solutions with a lesser number of unstable
directions (let's say only one)?

--vanessa:
I do not know of any proof that shows that there are no solutions with a
lesser number of unstable directions.  I did not find any solutions with
just one or two unstable directions, but at this point I cannot say
whether that is an indication that there are none or simply that
the procedure I used only identified solutions with 3+ unstable
directions.

\item[2004-09-15 Predrag]
Periodic solutions are useful if they are embedded into a chaotic
attractor. Do you have any measure of whether the typical solutions of
CGL, your parameter values, come close to any of the solutions that you
have found? If the periodic orbit is embedded into a chaotic attractor,
typical solution visits it infinitely often, infinitesimally close.

--vanessa:
This is something that I have not examined in detail.  I have observed (using
the ``naked eye") that the time evolution of typical trajectories (when viewed
by plotting the real versus imaginary part of A(x,t) at different times, as in
Figures 3,5,7 from the paper) sometimes resembles that of the first solution
found (i.e., the patterns displayed in Figure 3). (The first solution
found also happened to be the solution to which the solver I used
converged to most frequently.)  But I do not have a
quantitative measure of this ``resemblance".

\item[2004-09-15 Predrag] After talking to Lopez at SIAM
DS05 meeting: I do not think her \rpo s are the dynamically important
ones, so the problem remains wide open.

I read through Vanessa L{\'o}pez's paper (clearly a summary of a PhD
thesis), and while I a like {\rpo s}, I am very worried about the general
drift of the paper.

As I cannot tell how exhaustive is her set of numerical solutions, I do
not know what to make of them - like Zoldi and Greenside\rf{ZG96}, she
gets all of them with a large number unstable dimensions. Presumably none
of them are close to the asymptotic inertial manifold. More worrisome
still, she uses ZG `escape-time weighting' to ``average" over periodic orbits.

Here are some snippets from \refref{lop05rel}:

We work with the CGLE with cubic nonlinearity in one spatial dimension,
%\end{eqnarray}
\begin{equation}   \label{eq:cgle_pde}
    \frac {\partial A}{\partial t}  =
    R A + (1 + \mathrm{i} \nu) \frac{\partial^2 A}{\partial x^2} - (1 + \mathrm{i} \mu) A|A|^2,
\end{equation}
with periodic boundary conditions
\begin{equation}   \label{eq:cgle_bcs}
    A(x,t)  =  A(x+2\pi,t),
\end{equation}
and, as a convention, when we refer to \textit{the CGLE} we mean
equation~\refeq{eq:cgle_pde} with the boundary conditions
\refeq{eq:cgle_bcs}, unless otherwise noted. Equation~\refeq{eq:cgle_pde}
describes the evolution of a complex-valued field $A(x,t)$.

The CGLE has a three-parameter group ${\mathbb T}^2 \times \mathbb{R}$ of
continuous symmetries generated by space-time translations and a rotation
of the complex field $A$.  That is, if $A(x, t)$ is a solution of the
CGLE, then so is $\mathrm{e}^{\mathrm{i}\eta_1} A(x+\eta_2,  t+\tau)$ for any
element $(\eta_1, \eta_2)$ of the two-torus ${\mathbb T}^2$ and $\tau \in
\reals$.  Thus, we focus our study on time-periodic solutions of the CGLE
relative to the ${\mathbb T}^2$-symmetry, namely, solutions of the CGLE that
satisfy
\begin{equation}  \label{eq:Atpsol}
    A(x,t)  =  \mathrm{e}^{\mathrm{i}\varphi}A(x+S, t+T)
\end{equation}
for some $(\varphi, S) \in {\mathbb T}^2$ and $T > 0$.   Note that after a
period of time $T$, such a solution returns not to itself, but rather to
an element in its ${\mathbb T}^2$-orbit.  Such \emph{relative periodic
solutions} represent invariant three-tori in the CGLE flow.  Previous
studies of time-periodic solutions of the CGLE~\refeq{eq:cgle_pde} have
centered on two types of solutions.  The first are single-frequency
solutions of the form $A(x,t) = B(x) \mathrm{e}^{\mathrm{i}\omega t}$ (see, for
example, \refref{DaVuDel00,doelman89,KaMaPaa96}); these are referred to as
\emph{stationary solutions}.
\toCB

The second type are generalized traveling waves, also called
\emph{coherent structures}, for which $A(x,t) = \rho(x-vt)
\mathrm{e}^{\mathrm{i}\phi(x-vt)} \mathrm{e}^{\mathrm{i}\omega t}$, where $\rho$ and
$\phi$ are real-valued functions and $\omega$ is some frequency (see, for
example, \refref{AKcgl02,BTHmaw01, Mielke02,Mcoh03}).  These coherent
structures reduce to single-frequency solutions by a change to a moving
frame, that is, by a change of variables $x \rightarrow x+vt$, $t
\rightarrow t$.

The relative periodic solutions of interest in this study are different
in that they exhibit more complicated temporal behavior than the
single-frequency solutions just described. Studies of bifurcations to
(stable) invariant two and three-tori for the CGLE are described in
\refref{takac98} and references therein.

The \rpo s we compute, which represent invariant three-tori, are obtained
by working with fixed parameter values for the CGLE, not via a
bifurcation study.

They fix the overall $U(1)=\SOn{2}$ phase in a BEC problem, do not
reduce the remaining $D_4$ discrete symmetry. Only stable solutions,
we might be able to do this better.
													\toCB
More precisely: numerical methods break the symmetry of any given
problem, and the symmetry-breaking errors can be unpleasantly large. If
symmetry is reduced {\em prior} to numerical work, this does not happen.
Yet another argument why one should always reduce the symmetries prior to
the analysis of any given problem.

\emph{Slice \& dice} $\SOn{2} \times D_4$

Nico et al, I enjoyed your talk. Feel free to ignore the rest of this
email, but if you know literature or have some ideas that might help me
write up methods of symmetry reduction better, let me know.

You probably have not heard Ashley Willis and various spiraling patterns
talks, but in fluid and cardiac dynamics one has to deal with various
(rather simple) continuous and discrete symmetries. All I have found
useful on the subject so far is described "pedagogically" in Chapter 10
Relativity for cyclists (another version is given in Continuous symmetry
reduction and return maps for high-dimensional flows).

I also always quotient discrete symmetries, such as $D_2$ or $D_4$, as
described in Chapter 9 World in a mirror. That kind of thing you
appreciate only after you do it yourself.

As long as you look at a single stable equilibrium or travelling wave,
getting rid of $\SOn{2}$ seems not a problem. It becomes a problem once when
you start looking at sets of unstable solutions.

Visualization of all relative periodic orbits as periodic orbits we
attain only by global symmetry reductions. We do it by "slicing", ie
finding hypersurfaces that cut group orbits just like Poincare sections
cut time-evolution orbits. The problem is that the natural choice; a
hyperplane normal to a group orbit tangent vector (Lia algebra generator)
is only good locally, globally it runs into singularities.

Calling overall complex phase ``gauge invariance'' is a waste of an ugly
but otherwise quite precise word. In quantum field theory one means by
that the local (a very deep concept) not the relatively trivial global
overall complex phase. But AMO physicists do indeed do that.

\item[2010-06-05 Daniele Avitabile]
Our problem has, as you point out, $\SOn{2} \times D_4$ symmetry. What we would
like to achieve is exploring the symmetry-breaking bifurcation scenario
pertaining to $D_4$, in the case of stationary solutions. In other words,
we do not want to simulate the time-dependent solutions of the
Ginzburg-Landau system. We concentrate instead on stationary solutions,
and we want to see how, by breaking $D_4$, we can get new, hopefully
observable, steady states.

\item[2010-06-05 Predrag]
I think that you get equilibrium solutions only within subspaces fixed by
$D_4$ symmetries. The should be also $\SOn{2}$ travelling wave solutions,
perhaps also important. They would come in two flavors - with irrational
velocities, and pre-periodic, belonging to a discrete $C_m$ subgroup of
$\SOn{2}$. And you can bifurcate into Hopf cycles, traveling waves, periodic
orbits, relative periodic orbits etc., unless for some reason the physics
does not like anything time-dependent.

\item[2010-06-05 Daniele Avitabile]
In order to do that we need to factor out the continuous
group symmetry $\SOn{2}$. As far as I understood from your comments, we
should be careful in doing that, as the the phase condition that we chose
now  (seeking a solution in a hyperplane normal to a group-orbit tangent
vector) is valid only locally. Am I correct in interpreting your
statement? If so, I should say that we explore our stationary solutions
only by means of numerical continuation. With this method, the best we
can do *is to search locally*. What we need to make sure is that, once we
have a solution and perturb it, we can still invert our problem and find
a new steady solution. In other words, seeking for a solution locally is
the best we can do, as far as I can tell. Do you think we could be
missing some patterns by using our phase condition? I think your
observation would be absolutely crucial if our continuous symmetry group
was acting on the time-variable as well, and we wanted to simulate them.
A typical case would be continuing time-dependent patterns like spiral
waves or scroll waves. A method that comes to my mind in this context is
the ``Freezing method'' by Tuemmler and Beyn, which you will probably know. I
am pretty sure that this differs from the slicing method that you told us
about. A recent article by Hermann and Gottwald recaps the method and
contains an extensive set of references about it.

Now, let us assume that we manage to factor out $\SOn{2}$, either locally
with our phase condition, or globally via the slicing method. You mention
that you always quotient discrete symmetries. Would you recommend this in
our case? What is the danger in not factoring them out? My gut feeling is
that, by factoring $D_4$, for instance, we will make sure that we will find
just one solution on the group orbit. I don't think this is bad in
general, and I would be pleased to learn what are the problems associated
with it.

\item[2010-06-05 Predrag]
I have read Tuemmler and Beyn and believe ``freezing'' = ``slicing''.
Siminos and I have Hermann and Gottwald on our reading list, but have not
studied it yet. Tuemmler and Beyn impose a slice by adding a new
dimension (the phase parameter) and a condition (a Lagrange multiplier),
while we go one dimension down by restricting the dynamics into the
slice. Both approaches are standard in imposing Poincar\' sections; Rytis
Paskauskas has written that up for Chapter 3 - Discrete time dynamics
(not yet on the public version), and Chapter 13 - Fixed points, and how
to get them, Section 13.4 Flows. My feeling is that Tuemmler and Beyn is
better, but we have not implemented it. If you do use it, let me know how
it works.

Qihuai Liu and Dingbian Qian% \etal\rf{XXX},
{\em Modulated amplitude waves with nonzero phases in
     Bose-Einstein condensates},
\arXiv{1103.5277}, is unintelligible to me, but I would like to
understand what is the relation of MAWs to \reqva, \etc, so this is a
start. They say:

  ``
We consider uniformly propagating coherent structures of form
ansatz
\beq\label{LiQi11:2}
\psi(t,x)=R(x)\exp(i[\Theta(x)-\mu t]),
\eeq
where $R(x)\in\mathbb{R}$ gives the amplitude dynamics of the condensate
wave function, $\theta(x)$ determines the phase dynamics, and the
``chemical potential'' $\mu$, defined as the energy which takes to add
one more particle to the system, is proportional to the number of atoms
trapped in the condensate. When the (temporally periodic) coherent
structure is also spatially periodic, it is called a modulated amplitude
wave (MAW).
% \cite{brusch2000modulated,brusch2001modulated}
Similarly, a solution of the equation with the (temporally periodic)
coherent structure is called a quasi-periodic modulated amplitude wave
(QMAW) if it is also spatially quasi-periodic. If the phase of the
condensate wave function is trivial the MAW is a standing wave. Even the
amplitude $R(x)$ is $L$-periodic, the corresponding condensate wave
function $\psi(x,t)$ may be not periodic with respect to the spatial
variable $x$. If $2\pi/\nu$ and $L$ are rationally related, then
$\psi(x, t)$ is a MAW; otherwise $2\pi/\nu$ and $L$ are incommensurate,
and $\psi(x, t)$ is not periodic but quasi-periodic QMAW with the
frequency $\omega = \langle 2\pi/\nu,L\rangle$.
  ''

\section{Alternative periodic orbit `theories'}
\label{sec:CGL}
% Predrag  collected notes on Zoldi here  2012-09-17

{\bf [2012-09-13 Y.-Mee Predrag]}   %\toCB
Days of intense pain: because of Rich's paper which promiscuously cites
both good and nonsensical references on `Periodic Orbit Theory' I'll have
reread Zoldi and Kazantsev. It's like having to read papers on
alternative `Quantum Theories' by people who lacked patience or
background to learn the Schr\"odinger equation, but have their
home-cooked delirious heuristic `Theory' instead. I had assumed that with
time this gibberish would quietly disappear, but we unfortunately have to
address head on, because the nonsense keeps getting cited by reputable
researchers. So I have to explicitly refute them, without citing them, in
a remark for ChaosBook.org. Here are some preparatory notes. Uuurgh.

\remark{Alternative 'Periodic Orbit Theories'.}{\label{rem:Zoldi}
There are no `alternative periodic orbit theories'. There is only one
ergodic theory, just like there is only one quantum mechanics. Ergodic
theory is no less of a theory than quantum mechanics, but it is arguably
harder. While the eigenfunctions of quantum evolution operators are nice
smooth Hilbert space states, the eigenfunctions of deterministic
evolution operators are highly  singular, nowhere differentiable
functions with support on fractal sets. Quantum eigenstates can be
computed by computers, but there is no chance that the deterministic
eigenstates of high-dimensional dynamical systems can be computed without
much further thought. Were ergodic theory that easy, ChaosBook.org would
have been a much shorter book.

In the vast and vastly uneven \po\ literature (elementary kindness
dictates that erroneous papers not be cited) one sometimes encounters the
`escape-time weighting',
\beq
\expct{\obser} = \frac{\sum_p \tau_p \expct{\obser}_p}{\sum_p \tau_p}
\,, \qquad \tau_p = \frac{1}{\sum^{+}_j \Lyap_{p,j}}
\,,
\ee{ZoldiAv}
where $\Lyap_{p,j}$ are the nonnegative Floquet exponents of the prime
\po\ $p$, and the sum goes over all known \po s, and perhaps even
judiciously chosen subsets of \eqva.  As $\sum \Lyap^+_{p}$ has dimension
of $1/$[time], one may interpret $\tau_p$ as ``an estimate of the mean
time spent by the system in vicinity of \po.''

The  escape-time weighting \refeq{ZoldiAv} was introduced in a rapid
communication thusly: `Less unstable orbits must be weighted more
heavily, so the attractor dimension is approximated by `escape-time
weighting'. That's it: the `derivation' in its entirety. The escape-time
weighting is then asserted to approximate the dynamical average $\expct{\obser}$ of
observable $\obser$ over
the chaotic attractor in terms of the same quantity~$\expct{\obser}_p$
averaged over each and every prime \po\ $p$ found in a computer
exploration of the system's \statesp.

The great strength of the escape-time weighting approach is its charming
simplicity: if you have a dynamical problem, and if you have a computer
you have trained to troll for \po s, and if the computer brings back any
set of unstable \po s, you put $\Lyap_{p,j}$ and $\obser_p$ into the formula
\refeq{ZoldiAv} and you get a number back which you then publish.

The only drawback is that the `formula' is patently wrong for any number
of reasons: (1) It comes from nowhere; (2) $\tau_p$ has dimension of
$1/$[time], but a `weight' is dimensionless number, likelihood that an
ergodic trajectory enters the neighborhood of the \po\ $p$. To make this
into Lyapunov time one needs to specify the size of a ball of initial
conditions around an initial point on the \po\ $p$.; (3) $\sum_p$ is the
sum of {\em all} unstable \po s, regardless whether they belong to the
ergodic component under investigation or are dwell isolated in the Moon
orbit; (4) Yhe time ergodic orbit lingers in a neighborhood is determined
by least contracting stable multipliers (the time of approach) as well as
the least expanding unstable multipliers (the time of escape); (5) Level
sums (see \refsect{s:MarylandSums}) count all periodic points, not prime
cycles, (6) The weight $\tau_p$ is obviously wrong, as any periodic
orbit, no matter how long and unstable, has the comparable weight $\sum
\Lyap^+_{p}$, as long as its Lyapunovs (instability rate per unit time)
are the comparable. There is a fix for that in the literature, with
\refeq{ZoldiAv} replaced by
\beq
\expct{\obser}  = \frac{\sum_p \tau_p \expct{\obser}_p}{\sum_p \tau_p}
\,, \qquad \tau_p = \frac{\period{p}}{\sum \Lyap^+_{p}}
\,,
\ee{KazantsevAv}
with \period{p} the period of prime cycle $p$, derived thusly: ``it is
reasonable also to suppose that orbits with longer periods must be
weighted more heavily as they are longer and should provide a greater
contribution to the total sum.'' The modification does not help at all,
as the weight of a periodic orbit is determined by its dimensionless
Floquet \emph{multipliers} which grow/shrink exponentially with cycle
period (not Oseledec Lyapunov exponents which measure average
expansion/contraction \emph{rate per unit time}).

The strangest thing about `alternative Periodic Orbit Theories' is that
since (at least) 1987 there is no need for them whatsoever. The exact
spectral determinants use the same computational input as the wrong
formulas: \po s hierarchically ordered, and their Floquet multipliers,
periods and observables $\expct{\obser}_p$ averaged over $p$. It costs
exactly the same to compute the exact formula as it costs to compute
wrong formulas. Go figure...

Zoldi and Greenside\rf{ZG96} write:
``
Researchers have shown that knowledge of the short-period
\po s can often be used to estimate dynamical invariants of
a chaotic attractor such as its fractal dimension and
Lyapunov exponents\rf{AACI} and to improve forecasting of time

[...]
Theory that expresses the natural measure of an attractor in terms of the
set of \po s requires the assumption of hyperbolicity\rf{yorke2}, which fails for
most dynamical systems because of tangencies of stable and unstable
manifolds\rf{AACI} and because of unstable dimension
variability\rf{kostelich97}. The powerful cycle expansion method that
expresses averages in terms of a moderate number of \po s\rf{AACI} is
practical only if a symbolic dynamics ~unique labeling of each
\po \rf{AACI} is explicitly known and it is widely believed that most
dynamical systems lack a symbolic dynamics. Even if a system is
hyperbolic and has an explicit symbolic dynamics, it is still nontrivial
to calculate a relatively complete set of \po s from specified equations
or from measured time series to apply a cycle expansion. In the absence
of hyperbolicity and of a symbolic dynamics, it is not known how to
weight a given set of \po s so as to approximate a given statistical

[...] The convergence
of the escape time estimate to the Lyapunov dimension
is statistical in that the error decreases approximately as
$1/\sqrt{N}$, where N is the number of \po s contributing to the
weighted sum.
[{\bf 2004-09-15 Predrag} One is averaging over local Lyapunov exponents
by essentially random samples of \statesp\ points, so $1/\sqrt{N}$ is
about right. Garbage in, garbage out.]
Other previously published weightings of the \po s were tried
\rf{PawSchu91,yorke2} but were found not to give results as accurate as
our escape-time weighting, with relative errors larger than 10\%.
''


In \refref{Zoldi98} Zoldi writes
``
The aim of this paper is to examine the relative success and limitations
of trace formulas and escape-time weighting~(ETW) of \po s in predicting
the structure commonly found in histograms of chaotic time series data.
To this end, the Lorenz equations are well suited as they can model
a single-mode laser [11] allowing us to make qualitative comparisons with
recent chaotic multimode laser experiments that have intensity histograms
that exhibit sharp reproducible peaks [2].
[...]
We demonstrate that the structure of histograms of the chaotic $\ssp$
variable can be predicted in terms of the \po s of the Lorenz equations
using both trace formulas and ETW in the Axiom-A regime, and further we
demonstrate that ETW is more effective in the non-Axiom-A regime than
trace formulas.


In the unpublished \refref{Zoldi99} ``Escape time weighting of unstable
stationary solutions of spatiotemporal chaos'' Zoldi incorporates
unstable \eqva, and decides, for reasons known only to him to throw away
the asymmetric ones; \eqva\ that he keeps are precisely the \eqva\ that
\refrefs{ACHKW11,atlas12} find unphysical. If he adds these symmetric,
not isolated \eqva, he gets a better plot for time-average of the
Kuramoto-Sivashinsky chaotic trajectory~$ \langle u(t,x) \rangle_T$
estimated by the escape-time weighting~$\langle M \rangle$
of 80 symmetry pruned unstable stationary solution and 127 unstable
periodic orbit time-average patterns, than from 127 unstable periodic
orbits alone.

``
Our goal in this report is to demonstrate that the convergence of the ETW
average of \po s in the spatiotemporal chaotic Kuramoto-Sivashinsky
equation can be improved using unstable \eqva\ (he calls them
`unstable stationary solutions' (USS)).
[...]
We demonstrate that ETW converges as O(1/N) with N computed \po s and \eqva.
As no method exists to enumerate \po s and \eqva\  in nonlinear partial
differential equations, we use utilize damped-Newton algorithms\rf{ZG96} to
compute the \po s and \eqva.
[...]
Past work computing \eqva\ in the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation with
periodic boundary conditions demonstrated that the \eqva\ consisted of an
unexpectedly large class of stationary solutions, which include laminar
states, N-cell states (periodic patterns), long-wave modulated N-cell
states, giant states (large amplitude solutions), and traveling wave
states [18-20].
[...]
Many unstable stationary solutions were found to be isolated from the
chaotic attractor not resembling any chaotic solution. Other \eqva\ did
resemble chaotic solutions and exhibited small values of the difference
function,
\[
G(t) = \|u(t,x) - s(x)\|,
\]
where $u(t,x)$ denotes
the spatiotemporal chaotic field, $s(x)$ denotes the stationary
solution, and $\| \cdots \|$ denotes the infinity norm. Unfortunately
finding the minimum value of~$G(t)$ depends on recurrence times
of the spatiotemporal chaos, so we prune the set of computed \eqva\ by
requiring that stationary solutions have the same symmetry as the
time-average pattern of the chaotic attractor.  We impose the
constraint that the stationary solutions satisfy the condition that
$\partial_x^2 u(0) < 0$ and $\partial_x^2 u(L) > 0$.  This symmetry
pruning results in a set of 80 symmetry related \eqva.  We note that
this criteria does not remove all isolated \eqva.
''

[{\bf 2012-09-18 Predrag} Incorporating unstable \eqva\ is not crazy, as that
is the only situation for which \refeq{ZoldiAv} might make sense.
Contribution of an \eqv\ is evaluated in the boyscout version of ChaosBook.org

\item[2004-09-15 Predrag]
Regrettably Vanessa L{\'o}pez\rf{lop05rel} used the nonsensical
`escape-time weighting' formulas of Zoldi\rf{Zoldi98,ZG96} to ``average"
over periodic orbits. One cannot blame a computer science graduate
student for trying a formula published in Phys. Rev. Letters, but citing
it will just keep confusing future readers.  I had hoped I would never
see that stuff again. Dettmann and I tried to get Zoldi to derive
`escape-time weighting' for us, and Mainieri hired him at Los Alamos to
learn how this works. To best of my knowledge, we are all convinced that
it makes no sense whatsoever.

\item[2012-09-13 Predrag]   %\toCB

Kazantsev\rf{Kazantsev98} `weighted averages' \refeq{KazantsevAv} over \po s
(where $D$ is enstrophy probability distribution, $D_p$ is evaluated on
the prime \po\ of period $\period{p}$, $\sum_p \Lyap^+_{p}$ is the sum over
Floquet exponents with positive real parts) are a variant of Z \&\ G.

I cannot even guess where these formulas come from. Perhaps they write
them because initial work was on the stability of \eqva, where stability
exponents $\Lyap^+$ make sense? Read Charney and DeVore\rf{ChaDeVore79}.

The logic seems to be this: Zoldi\rf{Zoldi98,ZG96} `reasoning for this is
clear; less unstable orbits must be weighted more heavily, so the
attractor dimension is approximated as \refeq{ZoldiAv}, $\sum
\Lyap^+_{p}$ has dimension of $1/t$, so he interprets it as ``a priori
estimate of the mean time spent by the system in vicinity of \po.''
That's it: the `derivation'. The weight is obviously wrong, as any
periodic orbit, no matter how long and unstable, has the same weight
$\sum \Lyap^+_{p}$ as long as it's Lyapunovs (instability per unit time)
is the same. That Kazantsev fixes by saying ``it is reasonable also to
suppose that orbits with longer periods must be weighted more heavily as
they are longer and should provide a greater contribution to the total
sum.'' Thus he modifies it to \refeq{KazantsevAv}, which does not help at
all, as the weight of a periodic orbit is determined by its Floquet
multipliers which grow/shrink exponentially with cycle period (not
Oseledec Lyapunov exponents which measure average expansion/contraction
rate per unit time). Uurgh.

\item[2012-09-18 Predrag]
Still to read:

`Unstable dimension variability'\rf{kostelich97}. I do not even
comprehend that there is a problem; our \po s have varying number of
unstable Floquet multipliers. What's the problem with that?

I derived `cycle expansions' in 1986. They arose from trying to figure
out the scalings in period-doubling renormalization, and topology of the
H\'enon attractor (my pruning front theory\rf{pre88top}) developed at
Chalmers, Gothenburg 1985-1986 and at Cornell January-May 1985.

I do not publish until we have worked a topic in depth (cycle expansions were
developed in  PhD
theses of Artuso and Aurell, which we wrote up in \refrefs{AACI,AACII}, as well
as PhD theses of Christiansen, Rugh and Putkaradze. The pruning front theory
was developed in Hansen's PhD thesis\rf{hansen}.), but I did give
lots of conference and seminar talks about cycle expansions. Inter alia I
talked about the periodic-orbit topology of Lozi and H\'enon attractors,
and their cycle expansions at the ``\emph{Chaos and Related Nonlinear
Phenomena: Where do we go from here?}'', The Fritz Haber Int. Symposium
organized by Itamar Procaccia and held December 13--19, 1986 at Kiryat
Anavim kibbutz in Israel. A great meeting, and Celso Grebogi was in the
audience.

The story of Auerbach \etal\rf{pchaot} paper (submitted 13 March 1987)
was that we agreed that Procaccia would not show me the manuscript before
it was published, as I surely would have gone through the roof had I read
it (the collaborators were not ready to digest cycle expansion, so only
an`level sum' approximation to the trace formula is presented, and
applied to the H\'enon attractor (Eq.~(4) of the paper). Mysteriously,
this paper seems to be the most cited paper on on periodic orbits, at
least with my name on it. My first attempt to popularize cycle
expansions was the Phys. Rev. Letter\rf{inv}
\HREF{http://www.cns.gatech.edu/~predrag/papers/preprints.html\#Cycling}
{Invariant measurement} of strange sets in terms of cycles(submitted
March 1988).

Grebogi and the Maryland colleagues had written written many articles
about `UPOs' since, starting with\rf{yorke2} \emph{Unstable periodic
orbits and the dimensions of multifractal chaotic attractor} (submitted
September 1987), in which they presented a formula for the
natural measure in terms of the unstable periodic orbits (UPOs) with
large period embedded in a chaotic attractor, which is the approximate
trace formula in which periodic points are  weighted by products of the
unstable Floquet multipliers, their the Eq.~(14).  That paper cites only
Auerbach \etal\rf{pchaot}. Ever since then the Maryland school cites only
Maryland papers and some of the mathematicians of the 1970's, never the
Copenhagen papers. Maryland group is extraordinarily fond of baker's
maps. The trouble with baker's maps is that they have no curvatures and
no interesting shadowing so they offer no appreciation of spectral
determinants and their cycle expansions.

Ott in particular is an exquisite physicist, but the Maryland approach
was and remained heuristic, and there is no need for that. These
heuristic formulas are approximations to the exact trace formulas (that
are derived in ChaosBook with no more effort than the heuristic
approximations), but they are not smart for computations; much faster
convergence is obtained by using the cycle expansions of dynamical zeta
functions and Fredholm determinants. The cycle expansions are not
heuristic, they are exact expansion in the unstable periodic orbits for
classical dynamics, and semi-classically exact for quantum mechanics. The
first paper that derives them is, I believe, the above 1988 Phys. Rev.
Letter. The two long papers (combining the Artuso and Aurell PhD theses with
my own work) were better:

Recycling of strange sets: I. Cycle expansions (with R. Artuso and E.
Aurell), Nonlinearity 3, 325 (1990)

Recycling of strange sets: II. Applications (with R. Artuso and E.
Aurell), Nonlinearity 3, 361 (1990)

The most recent in the Maryland school series is

Comment on
``\HREF{http://arxiv.org/abs/0912.0596}
{\emph{Time-averaged properties}} \emph{of unstable periodic orbits and chaotic orbits}
in ordinary differential equation systems'' by Michael A. Zaks and Denis
S. Goldobin: It would not hurt to recycle these kinds of computations in
terms of spectral determinants, instead of sticking to evaluations of
approximate trace formulas. There is no extra work involved, except
reading relevant bits of ChaosBook, and inserting the same set of UPOs of
the Lorenz equations into cycle expansions. They should converge faster -
symbolic dynamics is a problem here, so perhaps one would need to use the
stability cutoffs.

If one is reluctant to refer to people with long, weird surnames, one can
always refer to Ruelle (not Bowen, he did not do that) for deriving the
dynamical (or Ruelle) zeta function. Sinai-Bowen-Ruelle work was much
smarter and more profound than vast majority of physicists' publications
from 1980s on. However, continuous time flow traces weighted by cycle
periods were introduced by Bowen who treated them as Poincaré section
suspensions weighted by the `time ceiling' function. But I do not see
cycle expansions that we use in Bowen's work (see, for example, the
description in \HREF{Scholarpedia.org/article/Bowen-Margulis_measure}
{Scholarpedia.org}).

This was never published:

Proc. Fritz Haber Int. Symposium ``Chaos and
Related Nonlinear Phenomena: Where do we go from here?'' Kiryat Anavim,
December 13--19, 1986, edited by I.
Procaccia (Plenum, New York, 1987).

The funny thing is that number of people have papers in it in their CVs
as published. Google sees right through.

I went looking back as Maryland papers are still cited when innocent try
to average over periodic orbits. They all have the same naive level sum
as Auerbach at al (that paper that precedes their first one, and is the
only paper with my name appended to authors list that they cite (at
least once) in their 400+ UPO papers). Grebogi never mentions me or
Kiryat Anavim or cycle expansions. So much meaningless business, and so
no time to try to understand a new idea.

I'm suffering through this because now that we have gotten plumbers into
recycling they promiscuously use whatever formula ever showed up in Phys
Rev...

The behavior of semiclassical approximations to the spectra of perturbed
quantum cat maps is examined as the perturbation parameter brings the
corresponding classical system into the nonhyperbolic regime. The
approximations are initially accurate but large errors are found to
appear in the traces and in the coefficients of the characteristic
polynomial after nonhyperbolic structures appear. Nevertheless, the
eigenvalues obtained from them remain accurate up to large perturbations.

\item[Recursive Projection Method] (RPM) by
Shroff and Keller\rf{shroff1099} might be of interest to us in numerical
work. RPM stabilizes fixed-point iterative procedures by computing a
projection onto the unstable subspace. On this subspace a Newton or
special Newton iteration is performed, and the fixed-point iteration is
used on the complement. The method is effective when the dimension of the
unstable subspace is small compared to the dimension of the system.
Examples are presented for computing unstable steady states. The RPM can
also be used to accelerate iterative procedures when slow convergence is
due to a few slowly decaying modes. PC also has 2 hard-copy, rather
readable old proceedings reprints by Keller\rf{Keller77,Keller79}. There
are some readable words about homotopy methods in \refref{AllgGeorg88}.


        Here we discuss these continuous symmetries as

\begin{enumerate}

        symmetries of 3-disk

        $C_n$ symmetry of $n$-slice pizza without reflection symmetry

In my \KS\ work with Christiansen, Putkaradze and Lan we
had excluded them ``by hand", by concentrating only on the space of
antisymmetric solutions. That is not good physics, as perturbations off
them mix into the full space of asymmetric solutions.


\item[{\Rpo s} in point vortex systems]

Laurent-Polz\rf{Laurent-Polz04} says: `` We give a method to determine
{\rpo s} in point vortex systems.

perform a symplectic reduction on a fixed point submanifold in
order to obtain a two-dimensional reduced \statesp. The method
is applied to point vortices systems on a sphere and on the
plane, but works for other surfaces with isotropy (cylinder,
ellipsoid, ...). The method permits also to determine some
{\reqva} and heteroclinic cycles connecting these {\reqva}.

{\Reqva} are orbits of the symmetry group action which are in-
variant under the flow, this corresponds here to motions of
point vortices which are stationary in a steadily rotating
frame. The existence and nonlinear stability of {\reqva} formed
of three vortices have been studied respectively in [KN98] and
[PM98].

Periodic orbits on the sphere were determined in [ST,To01]
thanks to the following method: they reduced the system to
two-dimensional systems by a symmetric reduction (using some
finite subgroups of $SO(3)$); the computation of the dynamics
on the reduced spaces permits then to determine periodic
orbits. Our paper is devoted to transpose that method to
determine {\rpo s}. To this end, we combine a symmetric
reduction together with a symplectic reduction.


Relative periodic orbits (RPOs for short) are the analogous of relative
equilibria concerning periodic orbits, this corresponds here to motions
which are periodic in a steadily rotating frame (a precise definition is
given in Section  ref~{methode}).

Let $F_t$ the flow of $X_H$. A point $p\in\p$ is said to be
\emph{periodic} if there exists a constant $T>0$ such that for all time
$t$, $F_{t+T}(p)=F_t(p)$. The \emph{period} is the smallest $T>0$ which
satisfies that condition. The set $\gamma=\{F_t(p)\mid t\in\reals\}$ is
called a \emph{periodic orbit}. Every point of $\gamma$ is periodic with
the same period, hence we can define \emph{the} period of a periodic
orbit.


A point $p\in\p$ is said to be a \emph{relative periodic point} if there
exist $g\in G^o$ and $T>0$ such that $F_{t+T}(p)=g\cdot F_t(p)$ for all
time $t$. The set $\gamma=\{F_t(p)\mid t\in\reals\}$ is called a
\emph{relative periodic orbit} (RPO), and every point of $\gamma$ is a
relative periodic point. In particular, a periodic orbit which is not a
\reqv\ is a RPO.

Note that there exist other equivalent definitions of a relative periodic
orbit  cite~{Or98}.

Typically a RPO is a solution which, in a suitably moving frame, looks time-periodic.

heteroclinic orbit  $\Longrightarrow$  heteroclinic orbit between
relative equilibria

Predrag: \Rpo s of this paper seem to be all of finite symmetry group
type, ie they are
all eventually periodic.



[Third Referee's Report Dr Newton]:
The manuscript considers {\rpo s} in point vortex systems that
arise from splitting {\reqv} configurations. It more
comprehensively treats problems of the type considered in
Souliere and Tokieda (2002) and Tokieda (2001). It is a very
nice paper.

alert them to our papers. In
{\em Semiclassical approach to discrete symmetries in quantum chaos},
\arXiv{1202.4998},
they say: ``
We use semiclassical methods to evaluate the spectral two-point
correlation function of quantum chaotic systems with discrete geometrical
symmetries. The energy spectra of these systems can be divided into
subspectra that are associated to irreducible representations of the
corresponding symmetry group. We show that for (spinless) time reversal
invariant systems the statistics inside these subspectra depend on the
type of irreducible representation. For real representations the spectral
statistics agree with those of the Gaussian Orthogonal Ensemble (GOE) of
Random Matrix Theory (RMT), whereas complex representations correspond to
the Gaussian Unitary Ensemble (GUE). For systems without time reversal
invariance all subspectra show GUE statistics. There are no correlations
between non-degenerate subspectra. Our techniques generalize recent
developments in the semiclassical approach to quantum chaos allowing one
to obtain full agreement with the two-point correlation function
predicted by RMT, including oscillatory contributions.

The Hilbert-Polya conjecture states that the imaginary parts of the zeros of
the Riemann zeta function are eigenvalues of a quantum hamiltonian. If so,
conjectures by Katz and Sarnak put this hamiltonian in Altland and Zirnbauer's
universality class C. This implies that the system must have a nonclassical

 theory}, \arXiv{1105.2527}, they say: ``
We reconsider the theory of the linear response of non-equilibrium steady
states to perturbations. We first show that by using a general functional
decomposition for space-time dependent forcings, we can define elementary
susceptibilities that allow to construct the response of the system to
general perturbations. Starting from the definition of SRB measure, we
then study the consequence of taking different sampling schemes for
analyzing the response of the system. We show that only a specific choice
of the time horizon for evaluating the response of the system to a
general time-dependent perturbation allows to obtain the formula first
presented by Ruelle. We also discuss the special case of periodic
perturbations, showing that when they are taken into consideration the
sampling can be fine-tuned to make the definition of the correct time
horizon immaterial. Finally, we discuss the implications of our results
in terms of strategies for analyzing the outputs of numerical experiments
by providing a critical review of a formula proposed by Reick.

Vrahatis\rf{Vrah95} claims to know how to compute periodic orbits. He says
``
The accurate computation of periodic orbits of nonlinear mappings and the
precise knowledge of their properties are very important for studying the
behavior of many dynamical systems of physical interest. In this paper,
we present an efficient numerical method for locating and computing to
any desired accuracy periodic orbits (stable, unstable, and complex) of
any period. The method described here is based on the topological degree
of the mapping and is particularly useful, since the only computable
information required is the algebraic signs of the components of the
mapping. This method always converges rapidly to a periodic orbit
independently of the initial guess and is particularly useful when the
mapping has many periodic orbits, stable and unstable, close to each
other, all of which are desired for the application. We illustrate this
method first on a two-dimensional quadratic mapping, used in the study of
beam dynamics in particle accelerators, to compute rapidly and accurately
its periodic orbits of periods p = 1, 5, 16, 144, 1296, 10368 and then
obtain periodic orbits of its four-dimensional complex version for
periods which also reach up to the thousands.

Gao, Xie and Lan\rf{GaXiLa11}
accelerate convergence of cycle expansions by dynamical conjugacies.

The key idea of this paper, of replacing the stability of an unstable
fixed-point or periodic orbit that a critical point is preperiodic to, by
the root corresponding to the order of the critical point was developed
in detail in a careful study of convergence by Artuso \etal\rf{AACII},
where it is shown that the change in convergence is due to a single fixed
point whose preimage is the critical point. It is shown how to modify the
cycle expansion to fix the convergence. The original $1/\zeta$ is kept,
but the pole induced by the critical point singularity is explicitly
factored out. The method is essentially a quadratic conjugacy restricted
to the critical point (Ulam map to tent map being the trivial example).

The innovation of this paper that goes beyond \refref{AACII} is the
explicit study of natural measures of such maps and use of conjugacies to
excise the singularities in the Ulam map (and its Misiurowicz family
generalization) settings. While \refref{AACII} motivates excision of the
singularity by a detailed study of many families of periodic orbits, the
authors accomplish this more elegantly, by a simple, well designed
conjugacy.

They are looking at the series of generalized Ulam maps, or what Ruelle
calls ``Misiurewicz maps'', where the critical point is preperiodic to,
ie  mapped onto an unstable cycle and thus rendered non-contracting.
Period 2 below is the next in sequence. The interesting new one is the
``Golden mean'' map, see for example exercise 11.6 in ChaosBook.org.
There the critical point is a part of the 3-cycle, so you know (at least
numerically) where the 3 measure singularities are. The answer is
somewhere in the literature. Perhaps in L.~Billings and E.~M.~Bollt,
``Invariant densities for skew tent maps,'' Chaos Solitons and Fractals
12, 365 (2001).

The step in $\rho(x)$ at $x_f$ is suspicious - perhaps the problem is that
the prefactor of the $1/\sqrt{|x-x_f|}$ singularity is different on the two
sides of $x_f$. How can a half-singularity at $x=0$ map into both sides of
$x_f$ neighborhood? Presumably the conjugacy (which they do not explain)
should be piecewise analytic, not smooth as in their figures.

Their $g(x)$ is a bad news - they seem to have introduced infinite slope
at an arbitrary point of the map. It's probably an artifact of the
unexplained method for constructing conjugacies - nothing interesting
happens here in the original dynamics. If they can argue that any periodic
orbit that includes critical point has this problem, that is interesting.
Again, the good conjugacy is probably piecewise analytic - the natural
measure they get has worrisome steps.

Here (and in all finite grammar cases they study) working out the
symbolic dynamics and Markov graphs of this map would help - they have to
understand which cycles form the fundamental set and which (families of)
shadowed cycles are causing wild oscillations in their figures, before
embarking on constructing a conjugacy. Original map has no cycles of
infinite instability, so their subsequent troubles presumably come from a
badly chosen conjugacy.

There can no be analytic conjugacy in higher dimensions - measure
singularities always sit on fractal sets, just observe pictures of
natural measure on the H\'enon attractor. Still, if you one find a
conjugacy that excises the neighborhood of the nearly-attracting
13-cycle, that would deal with the main impediment to zeta function
convergence in this case. The method cannot be generalized to higher
dimensions. For private amusement, just try constructing a 2-d conjugacy
for something like a H\'enon map $\to$ Lozi map. Good luck.

There is immense literature on measures of 1-d maps (A. Boyarski? A.
Lasota and M.C. Mackey\rf{LM94}? G. Froyland? E. Bollt? J. M.
Aguirregabiria, Robust chaos with prescribed natural invariant measure
and Lyapunov exponent; \arXiv{0907.3790}? D.J. Driebe, Fully Chaotic Map
and Broken Time Symmetry (Kluwer, 1999)? ... and authors would profit
from using some of that work to illustrate their ideas. They should do a
literature search on measures of 1-d maps. This is reminiscent of work on
natural measures published since 1980's by Hungarian school (Szapfalusy,
Tel, ...), Bollt, and many others.

1-d maps with a single critical point are very special, and unfortunately
little of this is useful in higher dimensions - already for the H\'enon
attractor there is a fractal set of critical points (ie, stable-unstable
manifold tangencies) and their images. No conjugacy or a finite set of
conjugacies can help there...

Liao\rf{Liao09,WaLiLi11,Liao11,Liao11a} is able to integrate Lorenz
equations with the 800-digit precision, using Mathematica with the
400th-order Taylor expansion for continuous functions. He gets ``clean''
numerical simulation of chaotic solution of Lorenz equation in a long
interval $0\leq t \leq 1000$ LTU (Lorenz time unit) with negligible
truncation and round-off error.   He found that,  to gain a solution in
$0\leq t \leq T_c$,  the initial conditions must be at least in the
accuracy of $10^{-2T_c/5}$.   Thus,  when $T_c = 1000$ LTU,  the initial
condition must be  in the accuracy of 400-digit precision at least. The
averaged velocity fluctuation in  a cube meter of fluid is $3.722 \times
10^{-30}$ m/s, so he starts simulations with initial standard deviation
$\sigma=10^{-30}$ (not clear why Lorenz origins in fluid dynamics justify
precisely $\sigma=10^{-30}$, but never mind) and integrate
deterministically (that is wrong too - integration should be
Fokker-Planck, not deterministic). The effects kicks in at 80 LTU, and by
120 LTU initial conditions are forgotten. ``This strongly suggests that
chaos builds a bridge from the micro-level uncertainty to   macroscopic
randomness, and  thus  is an origin of macroscopic randomness and  time's

Recently, I am working on the intermittency problem with periodic orbit
theory. We are trying to find a practical way for effectively doing
computations with cycle expansions. Besides the 1-d intermittency map, is
there a 2-d or 3-d system that is both intermittent and very closely
related to physics? We want our scheme to be tested in a real physical
situation.

I met a professor at a systems biology meeting who mentioned a way for
searching for periodic orbits with synchronization. It seems that no
Jacobian is needed at all in their computation. Please take a look at Lin

``[...] abundance
of unstable periodic orbits can be utilized in a wide variety of
theoretical and practical applications [19]. In particular, chaotic
communication techniques and methods of controlling chaos depend on this
property of chaotic attractors [12, 13]. In the first part of this
thesis, a control scheme for stabilizing the unstable periodic orbits of
chaotic systems is presented and the properties of these orbits are
investigated. The technique allows for creation of thousands of periodic
orbits. These approximated chaotic unstable periodic orbits are called
cupolets (Chaotic Unstable Periodic
Orbit-lets). We show that these orbits can be passed through
a phase transformation to a compact cupolet state that possesses a
wavelet-like structure and can be used to construct adaptive bases. The
cupolet transformation can be regarded as an alternative to Fourier and
wavelet transformations. In fact, this new framework provides a continuum
between Fourier and wavelet transformations and can be used in variety of
applications such as data and music compression, as well as image and
video processing. The key point in this method is that all of these
different dynamical behaviors are easily accessible via small controls.
This technique is implemented in order to produce cupolets which are
essentially approximate periodic orbits of the chaotic system. The orbits
are produced with small perturbations which in turn suggests that these
orbits might not be very far away from true periodic orbits. The controls
can be considered as external numerical errors that happen at some points
along the computer generated orbits. This raises the question of
shadowability of these orbits. It is very interesting to know if there
exists a true orbit of the system with a slightly different initial
condition that stays close to the computer generated orbit. This true
orbit, if it exists, is called a shadow and the computer generated orbit
is then said to be shadowable by a true orbit. We will present two
general purpose shadowing theorems for periodic and nonperiodic orbits of
ordinary differential equations. The theorems provide a way to establish
the existence of true periodic and non-periodic orbits near the
approximated ones. Both theorems are suitable for computations and the
shadowing distances, i.e., the distance between the true orbits and
approximated orbits are given by quantities computable form the vector
field of the differential equation.

Guralnik,  Pehlevan, and Guralnik, %\rf{XXX},
{\em On the asymptotics of the Hopf characteristic function},
\arXiv{1201.2793}, though we have never looked at $\beta$ large limit.

They write:

\renewcommand{\ssp}{x}
The invariant measure $\mu$ determines the frequency with which the a
chaotic trajectory may be found in a region of \statesp. The \emph{Hopf
characteristic function} is the Fourier Stieltjes transform of this
measure. For  a  dynamical system with \statesp\ variables
$\ssp_1,\cdots,\ssp_d$, the characteristic function $Z(\beta)$ is
defined\rf{hopf52,frisch} as the time average of \nobreak
$\exp\left(i\beta\cdot \ssp(t)\right)$
\begin{align}
Z(\beta)\equiv\left< \exp\left(i{\beta}\cdot{\ssp(t)}\right) \right>
 =\int \dMsr(\ssp)\exp\left(i{\beta}\cdot\ssp\right)\,,
\end{align}
where $\dMsr(\ssp)$ is the formal representation of the invariant
measure. The small $J$ behavior of the Hopf characteristic function
determines the equal time correlation functions of a chaotic attractor,
via the Taylor--Maclaurin series expansion in $\beta$. (Hopf
article\rf{hopf52} can be read
\HREF{http://www.iumj.indiana.edu/IUMJ/dfulltext.php?year=1952&volume=1&artid=51004}
{here}.)
The large $J$ behavior is related to the geometry of the attractor,
specifically its dimensionality. [...] the impossibility of defining  a
finite distribution function on the attractor or fractal.

When the invariant measure can be written in terms of a probability
density function, $\dMsr(\ssp)=\msr(\ssp)d^d X$,  where $\msr(\ssp)$
is everywhere finite, $Z(\beta)$ and $\msr(\ssp)$ are Fourier
transforms of each other. However in many systems of interest, the
dynamics is dissipative and a probability density function which is
everywhere finite does not exist, although it may exist as a
distribution.

If an everywhere finite $\msr$ did exist, it would satisfy
$\frac{d\msr}{dt} = -\msr \vec\nabla\cdot\vec v >0$ along any trajectory,
where $\vec v(\ssp)$ is the velocity $\frac{d\ssp}{dt}$, which is
inconsistent with Poincar\'e recurrence.

A sufficient condition for the existence of a Fourier transform is that
$Z(\beta)$ be ${\cal L}^2$, such that the integral $\int d^d J\,
Z(\beta)^*Z(\beta)$ converges.  Thus it would seem natural to define a
dimensionality corresponding to the maximum value of $s\le n$ such that
the integral
\begin{align}\label{defcon}
I_s=\int_{|J|>\epsilon} d^d J\, |J|^{s-n} |Z(\beta)|^2
\end{align}
converges.


The absence of a distribution function means that the measure $\dMsr$ can
not be written as $\msr(\ssp)d\ssp$ for any function $\msr(\ssp)$. In
this case the Fourier transform of the characteristic function, $\int
d\beta Z(\beta)\exp(i\beta\cdot \ssp)$, can not converge. [...] The
relationship between fractal measures and the asymptotics of their
Fourier-Stieltjes transform has been discussed in

R.~Ketzmerick, G.~Petschel and T.~Geisel, {\it Slow decay
of temporal correlations in quantum systems with Cantor spectra},
Phys.Rev.Lett {\bf 69} (1992) 695--698.

where it was shown that
\begin{align}
\frac{1}{J}\int_0^J dJ'\, |Z(J')|^2 \sim J^{-{\cal D}_2}
\end{align}
in the limit of large $J$, where ${\cal D}_2$ is the correlation
dimension of the fractal measure.

periodic orbits, which appears as a so-called q-phase transition in the
spatiotemporal configuration space. This intimate relation between phase
transitions and q-phase transitions leads to one natural way of defining
transitions and their order in extended chaotic systems. Furthermore, a
basis is obtained on which we can treat locally introduced control

phase transitions.

for periodic orbits might be good (reading

might be easier than the papers), and we should compare it to
Lan's\rf{CvitLanCrete02,lanVar1}. He says that while multi-shooting
Newton takes $O(d^3 \times n)$ computations, variational (or
`gradient-type') methods require only $O(d^{3/2} \times n)$.
The method is natural for him, as he is an expert on

See Eugene Kazantsev \HREF{http://www-ljk.imag.fr/membres/Kazantsev/}

He defines some arbitrary Euclidean \statesp\
distance $r=0.05$ as `vicinity' and finds 90\% (!) correlation with
episodes in which `barotropic ocean model' ergodic trajectory approaches
his \po, whose periods range from 40 to 250 days. That cannot possibly be
right - the duration of a visit to a neighborhood surely also depends on
the contracting eigenvalues - if they are weakly negative, you longer in
the neighborhood. Would not see that for Lorenz, as contracting
eigenvalues are strongly contractive. This is not even a Kaplan-Yorke
type formula, and that is easy to understand, even though his `dimension'
of a \po\ is Kaplan-Yorke dimension... Go figure. His `weighted formula'
for `dimension' is in the same ballpark as what he gets from dimension

barotropic channel model can have several equilibria, some unstable. Big
surprise. They butcher the model and keep 6 (six!) Fourier modes; \eqv\
conditions then yield a cubic equation. The {\stabmat} \Mvar\ is
[$6\!\times\!6$] but block diagonalized by symmetry into two
[$3\!\times\!3$], thus the eigenvalues are generically a real $\eigExp$
and a complex conjugate pair $\eigRe \pm i\,\eigIm$. They really really
do not understand that linearized stability eigenvectors of \eqva\ point
in whatever direction in the \statesp. They compute a particular
situation where there are 3, one that we would call `laminar' or lower
state, almost linear in Fourier modes, the one unstable (meteorologists
call it metastable `blocking' state) in-between that we would think of as
edge state, and one we would call `upper branch' that is unstable. A

Kazantsev also obsesses about `sensitivity of attractors' to
perturbations\rf{Kazantsev01,Kazantsev01a}; that might be worth including into
ChaosBook.org and evaluating using correct cycle expansion formulas
(read the paper
\HREF{http://www.nonlin-processes-geophys.net/8/281/2001/} {here}).
He writes: ``
A description of a deterministic chaotic system in
terms of unstable \po s is used to develop
a method of an a priori estimate of the sensitivity of statistical
averages of the solution to small external influences.
This method allows us to determine the forcing perturbation
which maximizes the norm of the perturbation of a statistical
moment of the solution on the attractor. The method was
applied to the barotropic ocean model in order to determine
the perturbation of the wind field which provides the greatest
perturbation of the model's climate. The estimates of perturbations
of the model's time mean solution and its mean
variance were compared with directly calculated values. The
comparison shows that some 20 UPOs is sufficient to realize
this approach and to obtain a good accuracy.

[...] To be able to determine the ``most dangerous'' external
influence to the climatic model, one has to solve an inverse
problem and use an a priori technique in the prediction
of climate changes. One way of developing an a priori
technique is based on fluctuation-dissipation relation, obtained
by Kraichan (1959) for Hamiltonian systems and used
in Branstator and Haupt (1998), Gritsoun and Dymnikov
(1999), Gritsoun (2001) for climate models with attractors.
This approach is rather simple and can easily been realized,
but its precision provides only a qualitative understanding of
the problem.

Another way to develop an a priori technique and to obtain
a better precision is based on the periodic orbit theory.
[...]
In practice, we cannot take into account all periodic orbits.
However, only a limited number of low-period orbits
may be sufficient for some purposes. This point of view is
argued in Hunt and Ott (1996b), Hunt and Ott (1996a). Numerous
recent studies confirm this hypothesis.
[...]
The accuracy obtained
in the approximation is rather good even when the number
of UPOs used is not large. Thus, the attractor of the Lorenz
model, its dimension, Lyapunov exponents
and Lyapunov vectors were characterized by the UPO set in
Franceschini et al. (1993), Eckhard and Ott (1994) and Trevisan
and Pancotti (1998). Attractor dimension and statistical
averages of the barotropic ocean model have been approximated
by UPOs in Kazantsev\rf{Kazantsev98}.

[...]
Sparrow (1982) proposed to use the
Newton method to locate unstable periodic orbits on the attractor
of the Lorenz model.
This method requires $O(d^3)$ operations
per iteration due to the requirement to calculate the
matrix of the Newton process and to solve the system of
equations with this matrix. Therefore, the method is limited
for use only with low-dimensional systems. To find UPOs
of high-dimensional systems, one can use the method proposed
in Kazantsev (1998). This method requires as many
operations per iteration as the model does (usually  $O(d^{3/2})$
or even $O(d \ln d)$).

In this paper, we describe an algorithm of evaluation of the
variations in statistical averages of the model solution caused
by perturbations in the right-hand side of the model. These
perturbations are suppose to be small and the linear response
of the model is considered.

They relax the enforcing of the dynamics trying to find the orbit that is
