\section{Symmetries imply possible existence of \rpo s}

In a dynamical system $\dot{a} = v(a)$ with a strange
invariant set, there exist infinitely many periodic orbits
\[ f^\period{}(a) = a \]
characterized by period $\period{}$, which are dense within
the invariant set. Here $f^t$ is the flow map of the flow
$v$, \ie, $a(t) = f^t(a)$ is the solution of the flow $v$
with initial condition $a(0) = a$.

Let the dynamical system have symmetries represented by the operators
$\Sigma_{k,s}$, where $k \in {\cal K} \subset \mathbb{Z}^p$ are
parameters of discrete symmetries and $s \in {\cal S} \subset \mathbb{R}^q$
are parameters of continuous symmetries.  In other words,
\[ f^t(\Sigma_{k,s} a) = \Sigma_{k,s} f^t(a)\,. \]
In this case it is likely that, in addition to \po s, the dynamical system also
has \rpo s, characterized by the condition
\[ \Sigma_{k,s}f^\period{}(a) = a\,, \]
where, in addition to the period $\period{}$, the \rpo\ is also characterized by
the symmetry parameters $k$ and/or $s$.

In fact, if the symmetry is continuous, then it is much more likely
to find \rpo s, than it is to find exact \po s, since $s = 0$,
corresponding to the \po , is only one specific value in the
continuum of possible values of parameter $s$.

In the case of KS equation, which has continuous symmetry
$\Shift_{\shift/L}$ and discrete symmetry $\Refl$, it is possible to
find \rpo s that satisfy one of the following conditions
\[
  \Shift_{\shift/L}f^\period{}(a) = a\,,
\quad\mbox{or}\quad
  \Refl\Shift_{\shift/L}f^\period{}(a) = a\,.
\]
The first condition is satisfied by \rpo s with shift $\shift$,
while \rpo s that satisfy the second condition are exactly periodic
($\shift = 0$) with period $2\period{}$.

The behavior of semiclassical approximations to the spectra of perturbed
quantum cat maps is examined as the perturbation parameter brings the
corresponding classical system into the nonhyperbolic regime. The
approximations are initially accurate but large errors are found to
appear in the traces and in the coefficients of the characteristic
polynomial after nonhyperbolic structures appear. Nevertheless, the
eigenvalues obtained from them remain accurate up to large perturbations.

\item[Recursive Projection Method] (RPM) by
Shroff and Keller\rf{shroff1099} might be of interest to us in numerical
work. RPM stabilizes fixed-point iterative procedures by computing a
projection onto the unstable subspace. On this subspace a Newton or
special Newton iteration is performed, and the fixed-point iteration is
used on the complement. The method is effective when the dimension of the
unstable subspace is small compared to the dimension of the system.
Examples are presented for computing unstable steady states. The RPM can
also be used to accelerate iterative procedures when slow convergence is
due to a few slowly decaying modes. PC also has 2 hard-copy, rather
readable old proceedings reprints by Keller\rf{Keller77,Keller79}. There
are some readable words about homotopy methods in \refref{AllgGeorg88}.

\item[{\Rpo s} of the complex Ginzburg-Landau]
V. Lopez, As far as the discussion about ``drift" is concerned:
In presence of continuous symmetries (for PC, streamwise and
spanwise translations) one should be searching for
{\reqva} and
{\rpo s} - they are most likely more important than
the \eqva\ and spatially periodic orbits.

I like {\rpo s} paper\rf{lop05rel} by
Vanessa L{\'o}pez %\rf{lopezLink},
%        http://www.cse.uiuc.edu/$\sim$vlopez:
``Relative Periodic Solutions of the Complex Ginzburg-Landau Equation"

% [From siads\@siam.org  Dec 22 2004]:
% willing to review this manuscript for Dwight Barkley.

A method of finding {\rpo s} for differential equations with
continuous symmetries is described and its utility demonstrated by computing
{\rpo s} for the one-dimensional complex Ginzburg-Landau
equation (CGLE) with periodic boundary conditions.  A {\rpo} is
a solution that is periodic in time, up to a transformation by an element of the
equation's symmetry group.  With the method used, {\rpo s} are
represented by a space-time Fourier series modified to include the symmetry
group element and are sought as solutions to a system of nonlinear algebraic
equations for the Fourier coefficients, group element, and time period.
{\Rpo s} found for the CGLE exhibit a wide variety of temporal
dynamics,
with the % sum of their positive Lyapunov exponents varying from 5.19 to
% 60.35 and their
unstable dimensions from 3 to 8.

15 Sep 2004, Predrag Cvitanovic:
All of your {\Rpo s} have many unstable
eigendirections. Do you know that there exist no other solutions with a
lesser number of unstable directions (let's say only one)?

--vanessa:
I do not know of any proof that shows that there are no solutions with a
lesser number of unstable directions.  I did not find any solutions with
just one or two unstable directions, but at this point I cannot say
whether that is an indication that there are none or simply that
the procedure I used only identified solutions with 3+ unstable
directions.

15 Sep 2004, Predrag Cvitanovic:
Periodic solutions are useful if they are embedded into a chaotic
attractor. Do you have any measure of whether the typical solutions of
CGL, your parameter values, come close to any of the solutions that you
have found? If the periodic orbit is embedded into a chaotic attractor,
typical solution visits it infinitely often, infinitesimally close.

--vanessa:
This is something that I have not examined in detail.  I have observed (using
the ``naked eye") that the time evolution of typical trajectories (when viewed
by plotting the real versus imaginary part of A(x,t) at different times, as in
Figures 3,5,7 from the paper) sometimes resembles that of the first solution
found (i.e., the patterns displayed in Figure 3). (The first solution
found also happened to be the solution to which the solver I used
converged to most frequently.)  But I do not have a
quantitative measure of this ``resemblance".

After talking to Lopez at SIAM DS05 meeting: I do not think
her \rpo s are the dynamically important ones, so the problem remains wide open.

I read through
Vanessa L{\'o}pez's paper (clearly a summary of a PhD thesis), and while I
a like {\rpo s}, I am very worried about the general drift
of the paper.

As I cannot tell how exhaustive is her set of numerical solutions, I do
not know what to make of them - like ZG, she gets all of them with a large
number unstable dimensions. Presumably none of them are close to the
asymptotic inertial manifold. More worrisome still, she uses ZG to
``average" over periodic orbits. That is regrettable - I hoped I would
never see that stuff again. Dettmann and I tried to get Zoldi to
derive this for us, and Mainieri actually hired him at Los Alamos to learn
how this works. We are all convinced that it makes no sense whatsoever.
Regrettably Lopez used the nonsensical formulas of Zoldy, so that will
just keep confusing future readers.
She is in computer science, so cannot
blame a graduate student for trying a formula published in Phys Rev Lett.

        Here we discuss these continuous symmetries as
a small-step limit of discrete symmetries:

\begin{enumerate}
\item
        symmetries of 3-disk
\item
        $C_n$ symmetry of $n$-slice pizza without reflection symmetry
\item
        Fourier analysis of periodic lattices
\item
        running modes in periodic lattice deterministic
           diffusion
\item
    celestial {\rpo s}
\end{enumerate}

The reading material for 1)-3) is on
http://www.cns.gatech.edu/courses/chaosSpring06

In my \KS\ work with Christiansen, Putkaradze and Lan we
had excluded them ``by hand", by concentrating only on the space of
antisymmetric solutions. That is not good physics, as perturbations off
them mix into the full space of asymmetric solutions.



\item[{\Rpo s} in point vortex systems]

Testing bibtex - these should exist:
\refrefs{lop05rel,McCordMontaldi} \refrefs{Vanderb}

Laurent-Polz\rf{Laurent-Polz04} say: We give a method to
determine {\rpo s} in point vortex systems.

perform a symplectic reduction on a fixed point submanifold in
order to obtain a two-dimensional reduced \statesp. The method
is applied to point vortices systems on a sphere and on the
plane, but works for other surfaces with isotropy (cylinder,
ellipsoid, ...). The method permits also to determine some
{\reqva} and heteroclinic cycles connecting these {\reqva}.

{\Reqva} are orbits of the symmetry group action which are in-
variant under the flow, this corresponds here to motions of
point vortices which are stationary in a steadily rotating
frame. The existence and nonlinear stability of {\reqva} formed
of three vortices have been studied respectively in [KN98] and
[PM98].

Periodic orbits on the sphere were determined in [ST,To01]
thanks to the following method: they reduced the system to
two-dimensional systems by a symmetric reduction (using some
finite subgroups of $SO(3)$); the computation of the dynamics
on the reduced spaces permits then to determine periodic
orbits. Our paper is devoted to transpose that method to
determine {\rpo s}. To this end, we combine a symmetric
reduction together with a symplectic reduction.

[Third Referee's Report Dr Newton]:
The manuscript considers {\rpo s} in point vortex systems that
arise from splitting {\reqv} configurations. It more
comprehensively treats problems of the type considered in
Souliere and Tokieda (2002) and Tokieda (2001). It is a very
nice paper.

Due to their exponential proliferation, long periodic orbits constitute a

attractor. The method does not require information on the system to be
controlled, nor on any reference states for the targets, and it overcomes
some of the difficulties encountered by other techniques. Assessments of
the method's effectiveness and robustness are given by means of the
application of the technique to the stabilization of unstable periodic
orbits in both discrete- and continuous-time systems.

Mark Srednicki has several interesting recent papers on Riemann zeros.
In {\em Nonclasssical Degrees of Freedom in the Riemann Hamiltonian},
\arXiv{1105.2342},
he says: ``
The Hilbert-Polya conjecture states that the imaginary parts of the zeros of
the Riemann zeta function are eigenvalues of a quantum hamiltonian. If so,
conjectures by Katz and Sarnak put this hamiltonian in Altland and Zirnbauer's
universality class C. This implies that the system must have a nonclassical
two-valued degree of freedom. In such a system, the dominant primitive periodic
orbits contribute to the density of states with a phase factor of -1, which
partially resolves a previously mysterious sign problem for oscillatory
contributions to the density of the Riemann zeros.

\item[2011-05-16 Predrag] I believe that Ruelle's linear response
theory is fundamentally wrong, as deterministic diffusion transport
coefficients are nowhere differentiable.
Lucarini \etal\ do like it. In
{\em Relevance of sampling schemes in light of Ruelle's linear response
 theory}, \arXiv{1105.2527}, they say: ``
We reconsider the theory of the linear response of non-equilibrium steady
states to perturbations. We first show that by using a general functional
decomposition for space-time dependent forcings, we can define elementary
susceptibilities that allow to construct the response of the system to general
perturbations. Starting from the definition of SRB measure, we then study the
consequence of taking different sampling schemes for analyzing the response of
the system. We show that only a specific choice of the time horizon for
evaluating the response of the system to a general time-dependent perturbation
allows to obtain the formula first presented by Ruelle. We also discuss the
special case of periodic perturbations, showing that when they are taken into
consideration the sampling can be fine-tuned to make the definition of the
correct time horizon immaterial. Finally, we discuss the implications of our
results in terms of strategies for analyzing the outputs of numerical
experiments by providing a critical review of a formula proposed by Reick.

Gao, Xie and Lan\rf{GaXiLa11}
accelerate convergence of cycle expansions by dynamical conjugacies.

The key idea of this paper, of replacing the stability of an unstable
fixed-point or periodic orbit that a critical point is preperiodic to, by
the root corresponding to the order of the critical point was developed
in detail in a careful study of convergence by Artuso \etal\rf{AACII},
where it is shown that the change in convergence is due to a single fixed
point whose preimage is the critical point. It is shown how to modify the
cycle expansion to fix the convergence. The original $1/\zeta$ is kept,
but the pole induced by the critical point singularity is explicitly
factored out. The method is essentially a quadratic conjugacy restricted
to the critical point (Ulam map to tent map being the trivial example).

The innovation of this paper that goes beyond \refref{AACII} is the
explicit study of natural measures of such maps and use of conjugacies to
excise the singularities in the Ulam map (and its Misiurowicz family
generalization) settings. While \refref{AACII} motivates excision of the
singularity by a detailed study of many families of periodic orbits, the
authors accomplish this more elegantly, by a simple, well designed
conjugacy.

They are looking at the series of generalized Ulam maps, or what Ruelle
calls ``Misiurewicz maps'', where the critical point is preperiodic to,
ie  mapped onto an unstable cycle and thus rendered non-contracting.
Period 2 below is the next in sequence. The interesting new one is the
``Golden mean'' map, see for example exercise 11.6 in ChaosBook.org.
There the critical point is a part of the 3-cycle, so you know (at least
numerically) where the 3 measure singularities are. The answer is
somewhere in the literature. Perhaps in L.~Billings and E.~M.~Bollt,
``Invariant densities for skew tent maps,'' Chaos Solitons and Fractals
12, 365 (2001).

The step in $\rho(x)$ at $x_f$ is suspicious - perhaps the problem is that
the prefactor of the $1/\sqrt{|x-x_f|}$ singularity is different on the two
sides of $x_f$. How can a half-singularity at $x=0$ map into both sides of
$x_f$ neighborhood? Presumably the conjugacy (which they do not explain)
should be piecewise analytic, not smooth as in their figures.

Their $g(x)$ is a bad news - they seem to have introduced infinite slope
at an arbitrary point of the map. It's probably an artifact of the
unexplained method for constructing conjugacies - nothing interesting
happens here in the original dynamics. If they can argue that any periodic
orbit that includes critical point has this problem, that is interesting.
Again, the good conjugacy is probably piecewise analytic - the natural
measure they get has worrisome steps.

Here (and in all finite grammar cases they study) working out the
symbolic dynamics and Markov graphs of this map would help - they have to
understand which cycles form the fundamental set and which (families of)
shadowed cycles are causing wild oscillations in their figures, before
embarking on constructing a conjugacy. Original map has no cycles of
infinite instability, so their subsequent troubles presumably come from a
badly chosen conjugacy.

There can no be analytic conjugacy in higher dimensions - measure
singularities always sit on fractal sets, just observe pictures of
natural measure on the H\'enon attractor. Still, if you one find a
conjugacy that excises the neighborhood of the nearly-attracting
13-cycle, that would deal with the main impediment to zeta function
convergence in this case. The method cannot be generalized to higher
dimensions. For private amusement, just try constructing a 2-d conjugacy
for something like a H\'enon map $\to$ Lozi map. Good luck.

There is immense literature on measures of 1-d maps (A. Boyarski? A.
Lasota and M.C. Mackey\rf{LM94}? G. Froyland? E. Bollt? J. M.
Aguirregabiria, Robust chaos with prescribed natural invariant measure
and Lyapunov exponent; \arXiv{0907.3790}? D.J. Driebe, Fully Chaotic Map
and Broken Time Symmetry (Kluwer, 1999)? ... and authors would profit
from using some of that work to illustrate their ideas. They should do a
literature search on measures of 1-d maps. This is reminiscent of work on
natural measures published since 1980's by Hungarian school (Szapfalusy,
Tel, ...), Bollt, and many others.

1-d maps with a single critical point are very special, and unfortunately
little of this is useful in higher dimensions - already for the H\'enon
attractor there is a fractal set of critical points (ie, stable-unstable
manifold tangencies) and their images. No conjugacy or a finite set of
conjugacies can help there...

{\em Modulated amplitude waves with nonzero phases in
     Bose-Einstein condensates},
\arXiv{1103.5277}, is unintelligible to me, but I would like to
understand what is the relation of MAWs to \reqva, \etc, so this is a
start. They say:

  ``
We consider uniformly propagating coherent structures of form
ansatz
\beq\label{LiQi11:2}
\psi(t,x)=R(x)\exp(i[\Theta(x)-\mu t]),
\eeq
where $R(x)\in\mathbb{R}$ gives the amplitude dynamics of the condensate
wave function, $\theta(x)$ determines the phase dynamics, and the
``chemical potential'' $\mu$, defined as the energy which takes to add
one more particle to the system, is proportional to the number of atoms
trapped in the condensate. When the (temporally periodic) coherent
structure is also spatially periodic, it is called a modulated amplitude
wave (MAW).
% \cite{brusch2000modulated,brusch2001modulated}
Similarly, a solution of the equation with the (temporally periodic)
coherent structure is called a quasi-periodic modulated amplitude wave
(QMAW) if it is also spatially quasi-periodic. If the phase of the
condensate wave function is trivial the MAW is a standing wave. Even the
amplitude $R(x)$ is $L$-periodic, the corresponding condensate wave
function $\psi(x,t)$ may be not periodic with respect to the spatial
variable $x$. If $2\pi/\nu$ and $L$ are rationally related, then
$\psi(x, t)$ is a MAW; otherwise $2\pi/\nu$ and $L$ are incommensurate,
and $\psi(x, t)$ is not periodic but quasi-periodic QMAW with the
frequency $\omega = \langle 2\pi/\nu,L\rangle$.

Liao\rf{Liao09,WaLiLi11,Liao11,Liao11a} is able to integrate Lorenz
equations with the 800-digit precision, using Mathematica with the
400th-order Taylor expansion for continuous functions. He gets ``clean''
numerical simulation of chaotic solution of Lorenz equation in a long
interval $0\leq t \leq 1000$ LTU (Lorenz time unit) with negligible
truncation and round-off error.   He found that,  to gain a solution in
$0\leq t \leq T_c$,  the initial conditions must be at least in the
accuracy of $10^{-2T_c/5}$.   Thus,  when $T_c = 1000$ LTU,  the initial
condition must be  in the accuracy of 400-digit precision at least. The
averaged velocity fluctuation in  a cube meter of fluid is $3.722 \times
10^{-30}$ m/s, so he starts simulations with initial standard deviation
$\sigma=10^{-30}$ (not clear why Lorenz origins in fluid dynamics justify
precisely $\sigma=10^{-30}$, but never mid) and integrate
deterministically (that is wrong too - integration should be
Fokker-Planck, not deterministic). The effects kicks in at 80 LTU, and by
120 LTU initial conditions are forgotten. ``This strongly suggests that
chaos builds a bridge from the micro-level uncertainty to   macroscopic
randomness, and  thus  is an origin of macroscopic randomness and  time's

By considering symbolic dynamics of the system one can introduce a

into clusters. Each cluster consists of orbits approaching closely each
other in the phase space. We study the distribution of cluster sizes for
the baker's map in the asymptotic limit of long trajectories. This
problem is equivalent to the one of counting degeneracies in the length
spectrum of the {\it de Bruijn} graphs. Based on this fact, we derive the
probability $\P_k$ that $k$ randomly chosen periodic orbits belong to the
same cluster, find asymptotic behaviour of the largest
cluster size $|Cl_{\max}|$ and derive the probability $P(t)$ that a
random periodic orbit belongs to a cluster of the size smaller than

Recently, I am working on the intermittency problem with periodic orbit
theory. We are trying to find a practical way for effectively doing
computations with cycle expansions. Besides the 1-d intermittency map, is
there a 2-d or 3-d system that is both intermittent and very closely
related to physics? We want our scheme to be tested in a real physical
situation.

I met a professor at a systems biology meeting who mentioned a way for
searching for periodic orbits with synchronization. It seems that no
Jacobian is needed at all in their computation. Please take a look at Lin
\etal\rf{LiMaFeCh10}, \emph{Locating unstable periodic orbits: {When}
adaptation integrates into delayed feedback control}.  This may provides
another approach for cycle detection. I do not know how efficient this
method is.
