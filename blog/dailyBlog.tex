\item[2013-09-11  Predrag] The last common entry with the svn repository
\\    \texttt{siminos/blog/dailyBlog.tex} is

{\bf [2013-03-14 Evangelos]} In
\emph{Quasiperiodic oscillations and homoclinic orbits in the nonlinear nonlocal
Schr\"odinger equation}, \arXiv{1303.3213}...

then the two blogs diverge.

\item[2013-11-15  Predrag] Moved Burak's blog from \texttt{gitHub} exile
to Evangelical home. This file is now only in \texttt{svn}
 \texttt{siminos/blog/dailyBlog.tex}.

The draft of the magic slice article still remains in the
 \texttt{gitHub} exile \texttt{reducesymm/cgang/}. We have to respect Divakar's edicts.

\item[2019-05-12 Burak] This is a blog entry for testing \texttt{gitHub} 
notifications.
