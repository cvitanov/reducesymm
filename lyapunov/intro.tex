\section{Introduction}
\label{sect:intro}

Inspired by the global
studies of \refrefs{PoGiYaMa06,ginelli-2007-99,YaTaGiChRa08,TaGiCh09} of
`covariant Lyapunov vectors' we use Floquet vectors of unstable \po s to
identify the \emph{local} number of degrees of freedom that capture the
physics of a `turbulent' PDE on a compact spatial domain. That number is
proportional to the system size, for \KS\ flow roughly four times the
number of positive/marginal Floquet (or Lyapunov) exponents, and twice its
Kaplan-Yorke estimate.

The idea is to coarsely cover the \emph{continuous-symmetry reduced}
nonlinear strange attractor with a set of
hyperplanes\rf{SiCvi10,FrCvi11}, as in \reffig{fig:Tesselate}. Any
adjacent pair intersects in a `ridge' hyperplane of one less dimension.
So our task is to, for a given strange attractor, pick a set of \Poincare
section-fixing points, such that each local section is approximately tangent to the
strange attractor. For simplicity here we shall consider only the flows
with a 1 continuous parameter (the time), postponing the more general
case of continuous symmetries to a happier time. An example of such
dynamics is the \KS\ flow restricted to the antisymmetric
subspace\rf{Christiansen97,lanCvit07};
some examples of flows with continuous
symmetries are the \KS\ flow on a periodic domain\rf{SCD07}, the pipe
flow\rf{ACHKW11} and the \pCf\rf{GHCW07}.

We propose to construct a global atlas by deploying a finite
number of linear \Poincare sections in
neighborhoods of the most important equilibria and/or periodic orbits
as local charts.
This is the periodic-orbit implementation of the idea of {\statesp\
tessellation} so dear to professional cyclists, \reffig{fig:Tesselate}.

\section{Charting the \statesp}
	\label{sec:chart}
% extracted from siminos/froehlich/slice/FrCv11.tex   2011-02-20

Work on \KS\ suggests how to proceed: it was shown in
\refrefs{lanCvit07,SCD07} that for turbulent/chaotic systems a set of
\Poincare sections is needed to capture the dynamics. The choice of
sections should reflect the dynamically dominant patterns seen in the
solutions of nonlinear PDEs. We propose to construct a global atlas of
the dimensionally \reducedsp\ $\pSRed$ by deploying linear \Poincare
sections $\PoincS{}^{(j)}$ across neighborhoods of the qualitatively most important
patterns $\slicep{}^{(j)}$.
We shall refer to these states as \emph{\template s}, each
represented in the \statesp\ $\pS$ of the system by
a \emph{\template\ point} $\slicep$. Together with the velocity
field at this point, a template defines a linear \Poincare section,
an affine hyperplane $\sspRed \in \PoincS$,
\beq
    \vel(\slicep) \cdot (\sspRed - \slicep)= 0
\,,
\ee{locTransvVar1}
locally normal to the $\vel(\slicep)$ at the \template\ point $\slicep$.
(For a discussion of inner products, see
\refappe{def:innerProduct}.)
(For a motivation, see
\refappe{s-POs-flows} \emph{Newton method for flows}.)
Each \Poincare section $\PoincS{}^{(j)}$, provides a local chart
at $\slicep{}^{(j)}$ for a
neighborhood of an important, qualitatively distinct class of solutions
(2-rolls states, 3-rolls states, \etc); together they `Voronoi'
tessellate  the curved manifold in which the reduced strange attractor is
embedded by a finite set of hyperplane
tiles\rf{rowley_reconstruction_2000,RoSa00}.

The physical task is to, for a given dynamical flow, pick a set of
qualitatively distinct {\template s} whose \Poincare sections are locally tangent
to the strange attractor\ES{Do you mean locally transverse?}.
A \Poincare section is a
($d\!-\!1$)\dmn\ hyperplane. If we pick another {\template} point
$\slicep{}^{(2)}$, it comes along with its own \Poincare section. Any
neighboring pair of $(d\!-\!1)$\dmn\ \Poincare sections intersects in a `ridge'
(`boundary,' `edge'), a $(d\!-\!2)$\dmn\ hyperplane, easy to compute.
A global atlas so constructed should be sufficiently
fine-grained: each `chart' or `tile,' bounded by ridges to
neighboring \Poincare sections, should be sufficiently small.

Follow an ant as it traces out a trajectory
$\sspRed{}^{(1)}(\tau)$, confined to the \Poincare section $\PoincS{}^{(1)}$
The
moment $\braket{(\sspRed{}^{(1)}(\tau)-\slicep{}^{(2)})}{\vel{}{}^{(2)}}$ changes
sign, the ant has crossed the ridge and  continues its merry stroll within the
$\PoincS{}^{(2)}$ \Poincare section.

There is a rub, though - you need to know how to pick the
neighboring {\template s}. This is a reflection of the flaw inherent in use
of a \Poincare section hyperplane globally: a \Poincare section is derived from the Euclidean
notion of distance, but for nonlinear flows the distance has to be
measured curvilinearly, along unstable
manifolds\rf{Christiansen97,DasBuch}. We nevertheless have to stick with
tessellation by linearized tangent spaces, as curvilinear charts appear
computationally prohibitive. Perhaps a glance at
\reffig{fig:Tesselate} helps visualize the problem; imagine that the
tiles belong to the
\Poincare sections through {\template} points on these orbits. One could slide
{\template s} along their trajectories until the pairs of straight line
segments connecting neighboring {\template} points are minimized, but
that is not physical: one would like the dynamical trajectories to cross
ridges as continuously as possible. So how is one to orient
the {\template s} relative to each other? The choice of the first template fixes all {\em
relative phases} to the succeeding {\template s}, as was demonstrated in
\refref{SCD07}: the universe of all other solutions is rigidly fixed
through a web of heteroclinic connections between them. This insight
garnered from study of a 1-dimensional \KS\ PDE is more remarkable still
when applied to the plane Couette flow\rf{GHCW07}, with 3-$d$ velocity
fields. The {\em relative phase} between
two {\template s} is thus fixed  by the shortest heteroclinic connection,
a rigid bridge from one neighborhood to the next. Once the relative phase
between the templates {\template s} is fixed, so are their their \Poincare sections,
\ie, their tangent hyperplanes, and their intersection, \ie, the  ridge
joining them.


\section{Conclusions}
    \label{sec:concl}

If a physical flow is confined to a lower-dimensional manifold, one should
use this fact to implement a dimensionality reduction.  In this
paper we have investigated dimensionality reduction by the method
linear \Poincare sections, a linear
procedure particularly simple and practical to implement.

 However, while a \Poincare section intersects each trajectory
  in a neighborhood of a {\template} only once, extended globally any
\Poincare section intersects a longer trajectory segment multiple times. So
it makes no sense physically to use one
\Poincare section globally. We propose instead to construct a global atlas by
deploying sets of linear \Poincare sections as charts of
neighborhoods of the most important (relative) equilibria and/or
(relative) periodic orbits.

Such global atlas should be sufficiently fine-grained.

It should be emphasized that the atlas so constructed retains the
dimensionality of the original problem. The full dynamics is faithfully
retained, we are \emph{not} constructing a lower-dimensional model of the
dynamics. Neighborhoods of unstable \eqva\ and \po s are dominated by
their unstable and least contracting stable eigenvalues and are, for all
practical purposes, low-dimensional. Traversals of the ridges are,
however, higher dimensional. For example, crossing from the neighborhood
of a two-rolls state into the neighborhood of a three-rolls state entails
going through a pattern `defect,' a rapid transient whose precise
description requires many Fourier modes. Nevertheless, the recent
progress on separation of `physical' and `hyperbolically isolated'
covariant Lyapunov
vectors\rf{PoGiYaMa06,ginelli-2007-99,YaTaGiChRa08,TaGiCh09} gives us
hope that the proposed atlas could provide a systematic and controllable
framework for construction of lower-dimensional models of `turbulent'
dynamics of dissipative PDEs.

One still has to show that the method can be implemented for a truly
high-dimensional flow. In \refref{SCD07} it was found that the
coexistence of four \eqva, two \reqva\ (traveling waves) and a nested
\fixedsp\ structure in an effectively $8$-dimensional \KS. Even more
importantly, a dimensionality reduction of pipe and \pCf s remains an
outstanding challenge\rf{ACHKW11}.

The Jacobian matrix $\jMps$ is sometimes referred to as the

{\em fundamental matrix}, a name inherited
from the theory of linear ODEs.
It is also sometimes called the {\em Fr\'echet derivative} of the
nonlinear mapping $\flow{t}{\ssp}$. It is often denoted $Df$, but
for our needs (we shall have to sort through a plethora of
related \jacobianMs) matrix notation $\jMps$ is more
economical. $\jMps$ describes the deformation of an
infinitesimal neighborhood at
finite time $t$ in the co-moving frame of $\ssp(t)$. %,

The nomenclature tends to be a bit confusing.
In referring to \velgradmat) ${\Mvar}$ defined in \refeq{DerMatrix}
as the {``\stabmat''} we follow Tabor\rf{Tabor89}.
												\toCB
All too often ${\Mvar}$,
which describes the instantaneous shear of the trajectory
point $\ssp(\xInit,t)$ is referred to as the `Jacobian
matrix,'
a particularly unfortunate usage when one considers
linearized stability of an \eqv\ point \refeq{eqPointStab}.
What Jacobi had in mind in his
1841 fundamental paper\rf{Jacobi1841} on the determinants today known as
`jacobians' were transformations between different coordinate frames,
\ie, in the present context, the
$\jMps^{t} = e^{t {\Mvar}}$ transformation of the local linearized
neighborhood.
These are dimensionless quantities,
while dim\-ens\-ion\-ally ${\Mvar}_{ij}$ is 1/[time].
More unfortunate still is referring to
$\jMps^{t} = e^{t {\Mvar}}$ as an `evolution operator,' which here
% (see \refsect{s_aver_ev_op})
refers to something altogether different.
In this book
\jacobianM\ $\jMps^{t}$ always refers to
\refeq{hOdes},
the linearized deformation after a finite time $t$, either for a
continuous time flow, or a discrete time mapping.
''

Additional notes:
Manos \etal\rf{MaSkAn11} refer to \refeq{lin_odes}
as the ``variational equations'' and
$\Mvar$ in \refeq{DerMatrix} as ``the Jacobian matrix'' of  $\vel$.

Since the last video-conference, Hugues and I have much developed our
study on the physical-spurious splitting in the KS equation using
periodic orbits.

Here I send you a summary of our latest results, which we think are
interesting and important enough to prepare a letter on that (Predrag's
copy is dowloadable
\HREF{http://www.scribd.com/fullscreen/60910182?access_key=key-2e56zhcvvnqo7amghf6j}
{110721Kazz.pdf} from Scribd.com). Attached is a summary and not a draft of
an article, and therefore words and structure are not refined enough, but
we think we can take it as a prototype of our article on this subject. We
didn't put your names as the authors simply because we don't know yet
what you think about our results.
,,

\item[2011-07-24 Siminos]
Is the spatial shift a multiple of the spatial discretization step?

\item[2011-07-25 Kazz]
No. First of all I use the quasispectral method for space discretization,
so I don't have any step in space. The spatial shift is expressed as a
shift in the phase of the Fourier modes, $e^{ik\ell}$ for a shift ${\ell}$ (which
can be any real number) for mode $k$.

However, it doesn't mean that our spatial and temporal shifts are really
the optimal ones. To determine the shift l, I look at the most weighted
Fourier mode ($k=2$ in the studied case) and match the shift with this
particular mode. Because this mode has a dominating weight in the power
spectrum, the value of l determined thereby is quite close to the best
one, but strictly speaking not. As for the resolution of the temporal
shift, it is obviously restricted by the choice of the time step.

\item[2011-07-24 Siminos]
Spatial shift in eq. (2) of 2011-07-21 draft seems to take care
of that, although this approach seems to be somewhat inefficient.

\item[2011-07-25 Kazz]
If you have a better idea, please let me know!

\item[2011-07-24 Siminos]
    Using ``the vector defined by the points of minimal distance along
    these two trajectories as a local approximation to the inertial
    manifold'' makes no sense to me. The local approximation to the
    inertial manifold is spanned by the transverse periodic orbit Floquet
    eigenvectors at that periodic point (simplest to take a local
    Poincaré section normal to $v(a)$ at $a$).

\item[2011-07-25 Kazz]
The problem about the Floquet eigenvectors is that, we cannot distinguish
physical and spurious modes for each periodic orbit (as explained in our
draft). Moreover, the goal here is to find a direct link between the
physical/spurious modes defined in the tangent space and the inertial
manifold defined in the phase space. This is why we studied the vector
connecting nearby points on the periodic orbit and on the chaotic
trajectory, both of which should be in the inertial manifold.

\item[2011-07-24 Siminos]
    I've actually raised the objection about the generic trajectory
    belonging to a different fold of the unstable manifold of the
    periodic orbit

\item[2011-07-25 Kazz]
I'm not sure about which results you are talking here and against what
I'm supposed to counter-argue. What I showed in Fig.5(c) is the numerical
observation that the angle between the difference vector (defined above;
between two nearby points in the inertial manifold) and the subspace
spanned by all the physical modes goes to zero proportionally to the
distance. This shows that for infinitesimal distances the difference
vector indeed lives in the "physical manifold" defined by all the
physical modes (NB: the unstable manifold is not the right one) in the
fold of the linear approximation. I don't make any reference to other
folds.

``
the fact that for UPOs the Lyapunov exponents and the
CLVs are simply given by its Floquet multipliers (eigenvalues)
and eigenvectors
''

\item[2011-07-25 Predrag 2 Kazz]
A factoid, not correct - next public update of ChaosBook.org should fix
that. The Lyapunov exponents are logs of \emph{singular values} of
$\jMps^{T}_p\jMps_p$ which are \emph{not} Floquet exponents of
\jacobianM\ $\jMps_p$. Only in the $t_p \to \infty$ limit the Oseledec
(1968) theorem\rf{lyaos} applies (and I am not even sure of that).

\item[2011-07-21 Kazz] writes in 110721Kazz.pdf:
``
When integrating UPOs, we retake the initial condition on each cycle
(adjustment in the order of 10-13 in u for the UPO mainly studied in the
following), in order to supprss numerical error accumulated during
integration. We confirm that the values of their Lyapunov exponents
computed thereby agree with the direct calculation of the Floquet
multipliers.
''

\item[2011-07-25 Predrag 2 Kazz]
Been through this many times, but anyway: wouldn't it be swell to
generalize Ginelli \etal\ so you do not run around a \po\ more than once?
The thing that is attractive to us about your methods is that you can
compute all eigenvectors, while we can compute only those whose
contracting multipliers (divided by the most expanding one) are above the
machine precision.

\item[2011-07-21 Kazz] writes in 110721Kazz.pdf:
``
In contrast, it seems impossible to set a well-defined threshold for the
CLVs of the UPOs.
''

\item[2011-07-25 Predrag 2 Kazz]
Do you understand my ``Daily blog'' comment  [2011-06-30 Predrag 2 Kazz]?
Almost all unstable cycles are nicely hyperbolic - only a very few cycles
close to tangencies will show glimpses of non-hyperbolicity. It's OK that
you do not see small angles on hyperbolic \po s - it should be this way.
If you actually looked at \statesp\ visualizations of the
flow\rf{SCD07,GHCW07,GibsonMovies}, you would most likely see that
episodes of small inter-eigenvector angles are spatially localized, and
concentrated on the most prominent near tangencies. Read also [2011-06-30
Predrag] on Kobayashi and Saiki, and [2011-07-02 Predrag] on Inubushi.

This communication in unspeakably laborious - it's like trying to deal
with reactor in Fukushima, while sitting in my Chicao apartment. Wouldn't
it be easier if you just checked out the repository, wrote into it
yourself, checked in the draft, and I edited it directly? Guess too
computer-nerdy for the 20th century ways...

Sorry, getting too late - need to go to bed.
