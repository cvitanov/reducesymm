%\item[2017-04-28
In 2017 Laporta\rf{Laporta17} completed the twenty-year
project of computing analytically the individual contributions
of 891 4-loop vertex diagrams contributing to the electron
magnetic moment $g$. Vertex diagrams separate
in 25 gauge-invariant sets (see \reffig{Laporta17figuragau}).
The numerical contribution of each set is
listed in \reftab{Laporta17:tableset}.
Adding only the quenched set $V$ diagrams (\ie, diagrams with no lepton
loops, see \reffig{tabGaugeSets} and \ref{Laporta17figuragauShort}), one
finds for the 4- and 5-loop contributions to the anomaly
$a[V]=\left.\frac{1}{2}(g-2)\right|_V$:
\bea
 a^{(8)}[V] &=& -2.176866027739540077443259355895893938670

%\end{align}
There is a prediction dating back to 1977 for values of these terms: the
predicted $a^{(8)}[V] \approx 0$ does not pan out,
but the difference is small, considering that this
is a sum of 518 vertex diagrams (or 47 self-energy
diagrams)\rf{KinLin90}.
Likewise, the prediction for $a^{(10)}[V]$ is not too far off, considering
that this is a sum of 6354 vertex diagrams of \reftab{Cvit77bTab1} (or
389 self-energy diagrams).

Why are these numbers so small?
As a prelude to these notes, you might enjoy the
introduction to Dunne and Schubert 2005 paper\rf{DunSch06}
which starts with a historical review of ideas about the QED
perturbation series. They note:
``[...]
a point which remains poorly understood is the influence of gauge
cancellations on the divergence structure of a gauge theory.''

In this spirit, I start here by explaining the numerics that motivated
the 1977 QED finiteness conjecture, and then review the approaches that
offer a promise of establishing it. A proof of the conjecture might be
within reach; so might be methods for computing gauge invariant QFT sets,
without recourse to traditional Feynman diagrams.
A fun fact is that the idea of how to avoid Feynman diagrams can also be
traced to 1950 Feynman paper\rf{Feynman50}, though it took a long time for
it to gain traction. By the time I explained the gauge set conjecture to
him in 1975, Feynman had forgotten all about it.

Consider the electron-photon vertex of quantum electrodynamics, evaluated
on the electron mass-shell $p^2=k^2=m^2$. By Gordon decomposition the
vertex can be written in terms of the Dirac and Pauli form factors
$F_1(q^2)$ and $F_2(q^2)$:
\bea
\overline{u}(p) \Gamma_{\mu}(p,k,q)\Big|_{k^2=p^2=m^2} u(k)
    &=& \label{BAGTB17(35-1)} \\
    && \hspace{-4.5cm}
\overline{u}(p) \Bigg\{ F_1(q^2) \gamma_{\mu} -
\frac{F_2 (q^2)}{2m} \; \sigma_{\mu \nu} q^{\nu} \Bigg\} u(k) \,,
\nonumber
\eea
where the spinors  $\overline{u}(p)$ and $u(k)$  satisfy the Dirac
equation:
\[
\overline{u}(p) \not\!{p} = m \, \overline{u}(p)
\,, \qquad
\not\!{k} \, u(k)  =  m \, u(k) \,,
\]
and $q=p-k$. The Dirac equation predicts that the magnetic moment of an
electron of charge $e$ and mass $m$ is ${ {\mu}} = {e}/{(2 m)} $.
%The anomalous magnetic moment $F_2(0)$ is measured at vanishing photon
%momentum transfer, $q^2=0$.
In the absence of radiative corrections
$F_1(0)=1$ and $F_2(0)$. In 1948 Schwinger\rf{Schwinger48} showed that in
the leading, one-loop order in the fine structure constant $\alpha$, the
radiative corrections lead to the anomalous magnetic moment of form
$F_2(0)={\alpha}/{2\pi}+ a^{(2)}\left({\alpha}/{\pi}\right)^2 +
\cdots$
(this result is engraved on his

In 1972 Toichiro Kinoshita and I had completed computing a large number
of 3-loop anomalous magnetic moment Feynman diagrams and regularization
counterterms\rf{CviKin72}, \reffig{JegNif09fig10}.
The subsequent 4- and 5-loop numerical and analytic calculations
are nothing short of heroic\rf{KinLin90,LapRem96,Laporta17,AoHaKiNi15}.
We had used the quantum field theory in the standard way, by expanding
the magnetic moment into combinatorially many Feynman diagrams (see the
numbers of vertex graphs in \reftab{Cvit77bTab1}).
Each Feynman diagram corresponds to an integral in many dimensions, with
oscillatory integrand with thousands of terms, each integral separately
UV divergent, IR divergent, and unphysical, as its value depends on the
definition of counterterms and the choice of gauge. In our calculations
the numerical values of these integrals typically ranged from  $\pm 10$
to $\pm 100$.

We added up hundreds of such contributions, of wildly fluctuating values,
and obtained (for the no-fermion loops subset $V$, in the notation of
\refref{AoHaKiNi15})
\[
 \aql{6}\,=\, +  (0.92 \pm 0.02) \left(\frac{\alpha}{\pi}\right)^3.
\]
But why ``+'' and not ``-''? Why so small? Why does a sum of hundreds of
diagrams and counterterms yield a number of order of unity, and not 10 or
100 or any other number?

If gauge invariance of QED guarantees that all UV and on-mass shell IR
divergences cancel, could it be that it also enforces cancellations among
the finite on-mass shell contributions?

As first noted by Lautrup, Peterman and de Rafael\rf{LaPeRa72}, the
renormalized on-mass shell QED vertex diagrams separate into a sum of
minimal gauge-invariant subsets, each subset separately UV and IR finite.
To simplify matters, in what follows we shall consider only the
no-fermion loop diagrams, or `quenched-', or `q-type' diagrams
(`quenched', as this corresponds to the $N_f$-independent part of the
vertex amplitude in
QED with $N_f$ flavors).
The minimal gauge-invariant subsets without electron loops (see
\reffig{JegNif09fig10} diagrams $\{23-72\}$; \reffig{Cvit77bFig1};
\ref{Cvit77bFig2}; \ref{Cvit77bFig3}; and \ref{Laporta17figuragauShort})
will be hereafter be referred to as \emph{gauge sets}.

A gauge set
$(k,m,m')$ consists of all 1-particle irreducible vertex diagrams
without electron loops, with $k$ photons crossing the external vertex
(cross-photons) and $m [m']$ photons originating and terminating on the
incoming [outgoing] electron leg (leg-photons), where $m\geq m'$. For
asymmetric pairs of sets, with $m\neq m'$, the contribution to the
anomaly $a_{kmm'}$ is, in my definition, the sum of the set and its
mirror (time-reversed) image,
\beq
a[V]=\left.\frac{1}{2}(g-2)\right|_V
       =  \sum_{k=1}^\infty\sum_{m=0}^\infty\sum_{m'=0}^m
          a_{kmm'}\left(\frac{\alpha}{\pi}\right)^{k+m+m'}
\,.
\ee{quenchAnom}

When the diagrams that we had computed\rf{CviKin74c} are grouped into
gauge sets, \reffig{Cvit77bFig1} to \reffig{Laporta17figuragauShort},
a surprising thing happens; while the
finite part of each Feynman diagram is of order of 10 to 100, every
 gauge set known at that time added up to approximately
$$
		   \pm {1 \over 2} \left(\frac{\alpha}{\pi}\right)^n
\,,
$$
with the sign given by a simple empirical rule
\beq
a_{kmm'} = (-1)^{m+m'}\frac{1}{2}
\,.
\ee{Cvit77b(5)}
The sign rule is further corroborated by sets with photon
self-energy insertions (but with the absolute size scaled down to
$3-15\%$ of \refeq{Cvit77b(5)}).
In \reffig{Cvit77bFig3} I compared this rule with the actual numbers and
made the 1977 four-loop prediction\rf{Cvit77b}.
With that prediction, the ``zeroth'' order estimate of the electron
magnetic moment anomaly $a$ is given by the ``gauge-set
approximation,'' convergent and summable to all orders
\beq
a=\frac{1}{2}(g-2) =  \frac{1}{2} \frac{\alpha}{\pi}
                     \frac{1}
           {\left( 1 - \left(\frac{\alpha}{\pi}\right)^2
			\right)^2
		      } + \mbox{``corrections"}
\,.
\ee{Cvit77b(1)}
This is not how one usually thinks of perturbation theory. Most of our
colleagues believe that in 1952 Dyson\rf{Dyson52} had  shown that the
perturbation expansion is an asymptotic series (for a discussion, see
Dunne and Schubert\rf{DunSch06,HuTrSc17a}), in the sense that the $n$-th order
contribution should be exploding combinatorially
$$
{1 \over 2} (g-2) \approx
\cdots + n^n \left(\frac{\alpha}{\pi}\right)^n + \cdots
\,,
$$
and not growing slowly like my estimate
\[
{1 \over 2} (g-2) \approx
\cdots + \frac{n}{2}\left(\frac{\alpha}{\pi}\right)^{2n} + \cdots
\,.
\]
For me, the above is the most intriguing hint that something deeper than
what we know today underlies quantum field theory, and the most suggestive
lesson of our calculation.

\subsection{Self-energy sets}
\label{sect:selfEnergy}

There are two ways of grouping vertex diagrams, into \emph{gauge sets},
and into \emph{self-energy sets} (or the ``externally gauge-invariant''
sets). Every vertex diagram belongs both to a gauge set and to a
self-energy set, as illustrated by \reffig{Cvit77bFig2}.
Formulation of the $(g-2)$ computation directly from self-energy graphs
is due to
\HREF{http://chaosbook.org/~predrag/papers/preprints.html\#PerturbativeQED}
{Cvitanovi\'{c} and Kinoshita}, see the ``new formula'' (6.22) in
\refref{CviKin74c}. Not only does
the calculation use fewer Feynman graphs, but it was very important for
us, as it enabled us to calculate the 3-loop electron magnetic moment by
two independent methods (and in this way we did actually identify and
eliminate a subtle numerical error in one of the graphs).
Parenthetically, Carroll papers\rf{CarYao74,Carroll75} puzzle me. He
gives the credit for self-energy sets to the mass-operator formalism of
Schwinger\rf{Schwinger51a,Schwinger51b,Sommerfield58}, but no credit to
us\rf{CviKin74c}, even though his papers look closer to ours than to
Schwinger and Sommerfield; he cites us, his derivation is also based on
the Ward-Takahashi identity. Our formulation might be equivalent to
Schwinger's, but it looks quite different in detail, and I was not aware
of Schwinger mass-operator when we derived it.

The gauge sets are minimal, and separately gauge invariant (for a proof,
see \refref{Cvit77b}). The self-energy sets are not, only their sum is
gauge invariant.
Unlike gauge sets, whose number grows polynomially, the number of
self-energy sets grows combinatorially - they save significant amount
of computing for few-loops computations, but cannot be used to argue the
finiteness of QED.
That is the reason why Aoyama \etal\rf{AoHaKiNi12,AoHaKiNi15}
calculations have nothing to say about the 1977 conjecture\rf{Cvit77b}:
they do not compute individual vertex diagrams, but only the self-energy
sets, and for them the set of all diagrams without a fermion loop
(`quenched-' or `q-type' diagrams) is a single `gauge-invariant set'
$V$. For example, for 5-loops the set $V$ is a sum of 9 vertex gauge sets
(where time-reversed pairs count as one set, see \reffig{tabGaugeSets}),
but Aoyama \etal\rf{AoHaKiNi15} only give their sum \refeq{anomalValues}.

\noindent
Aoyama \etal\ 5-loop calculations already push the envelope of what is
numerically attainable, they would be loath to switch from self-energy
diagrams formulation to the vertex diagrams formulation, it would mean
(for the quenched set $V$) going from 389 self-energy graphs to 6354
vertex diagrams. Stefano Laporta deserves a bit of well earned rest. So
what is ahead?
I've now reread much of the relevant literature known to me. There might
be much more - people who do things related to my 1977 paper\rf{Cvit77b}
never alert me to their papers, presumably because the reports of my
death have been greatly exaggerated.

At this time, Sergey  A. Volkov appears to be the
only person set up do the requisite 5-loop calculations,
see \refsect{sect:Volkov}.

Two approaches might be relevant to
establishing bounds on, and perhaps even the direct computation
of gauge sets (ignoring the $N\!=\!2$ and $N\!=\!4$
supersymmetric models):
(1) \emph{Hopf algebraic approach} of Kreimer and collaborators,
see \refsect{sect:HopfAlgebra},
and
(2)
\emph{worldline formalism} pursued by
\HREF{http://www.ifm.umich.mx/ifm/index.php/fisca/academicos/schubert/}
{Schubert} and collaborators,
see \refsect{sect:worldline}.

\subsection{Volkov method}
\label{sect:Volkov}

In \refref{Volkov16} Volkov explains that $A_1^{(2n)}$ is free from
infrared divergences since they are removed by the on-shell
renormalization.
However, Volkov also states that there is no universal method in QED for
canceling IR divergences in the Feynman graphs analogous to the R
operation, and that the standard subtractive on-shell renormalization
cannot remove IR divergences point-by-point in Feynman-parametric space,
as it does for UV divergences. Moreover, it can generate additional
IR-divergences.

That QED on-mass shell amplitudes are IR-free must be an old result; even
I have several papers generalizing that to
QCD\rf{MassShell,IRstruct,QCDmshell,NPB81}. Tom Kinoshita and I solved
the problem of point-by-point removal of IR divergences in
Feynman-parametric space in my thesis\rf{CviKin74b}, with a
super-elegant formula (who needs forests?) for the UV and IR finite part
of amplitude $M_G$,
\beq
\Delta M_G =\prod_{ij}(1-I_{G/S_i})(1-K_{G/S_j}) M_G
\,,
\ee{UV-IRfiniteGcorr}
where the products are over all self-energy and vertex subdiagrams $S_i$
and $S_j$.
I have a bright memory of figuring out how to do it one quiet evening in
Ithaca, babysitting for a friend's toddler. But, as Volkov\rf{Volkov16}
and Aoyama \etal\rf{AoHaKiNiWa08} explain, our approach was apparently
not general enough to deal with the 4- and 5-loop contributions.

Volkov's algorithm is developed in {\em New method of computing the
contributions of graphs without lepton loops to the electron anomalous
magnetic moment in {QED}}\rf{Volkov17}. It is based on the ideas used for
proving UV-finiteness of renormalized Feynman
amplitudes\rf{Speer68,AnZaPo73}. He focuses on $n$-loop graphs with no
lepton loops, or, in the notation of these notes, $a^{(2n)}[V]$.
%
Volkov calculation groups Feynman graphs by self-energy graphs families
because they have similar integrand structure. In contrast to
\refrefs{CviKin74c,CarYao74,Carroll75,AoHaKiNi15} he does not evaluate
these self-energy graphs directly; all his calculations are performed
with vertex graphs, \ie, precisely what is needed to evaluate gauge sets
of \refsect{sect:finitness}. However, as illustrated in
\reffig{Cvit77bFig3}, each gauge-set vertex diagram belongs to a
different self-energy diagram, so Volkov calculation will require a major
reorganization of how integrands are generated, requiring several months
of recoding.

So far Volkov  has evaluated the ladder graph
%(Figure \ref{fig_ladder})
and the fully crossed graph
%(Figure \ref{fig_crosses})
up to 5 loops. The cross graphs are of interest because they do not
contain divergent subgraphs, so their contributions only depend on the
gauge, but not on the choice of subtraction procedure.

While the contributions of individual vertex graphs (and self-energy
sets\rf{AoHaKiNi15}) are all over the place, all gauge-invariant sets are
insanely small up to order 8, and it would be very sweet to see that this
continues through order 10 (at least for the 5-loop graphs with no
electron loops).
My hunch is that starting with the gauge set $(5,0,0)$ of
\reffig{tabGaugeSets} ($5!$ vertex graphs, some of them symmetric pairs)
would be the most rewarding.
Stefano Laporta thinks it too hard, and suggests starting with the 5-loop
relative
$(1,3,1)$ (or $(1,2,2)$) of the 4-loop set $(1,2,1)$,
which would entail less than $5!$ vertex graphs (I have not counted
how many). As no high accuracy is needed, a numerical check of the QED
finiteness conjecture would good enough if the gauge sets evaluated
to two significant digits or so, but even that will need a lot of
computer time.

\subsection{Hopf algebraic approach}
\label{sect:HopfAlgebra}

Hopf algebraic approach of Kreimer and collaborators\rf{BrDeKr96,
Kreimer00, KreYea08, KisKre16} is very appealing - it is just that I
personally have no clue how to turn it into a direct $(g-2)$ gauge set
calculation. In the 2008 paper\rf{KreYea08}
\HREF{https://www2.mathematik.hu-berlin.de/~kreimer/} {Dirk Kreimer} and
\HREF{https://arxiv.org/find/math-ph,math/1/au:+Yeats_K/0/1/0/all/0/1}
{Karen Yeats} write:
    \begin{quote}
``One case where there is a natural interpretation is QED with a linear
number of generators, namely
\beq
X_1 = 1 + \sum_{k \geq 1}p(k)x^k
      \frac{X_1^{2k+1}}
           {(1-X_2)^{2k}(1-X_3)^{2k}}
\,,
\ee{KreYea08p413}
with $X_2$ and $X_3$ as before and with $p(k)$ linear, which corresponds
to counting with Cvitanovi\'c's gauge invariant sectors\rf{Cvit77b}.''
    \end{quote}
%{\bf 2017-05-31 Predrag}
Even in this simple case I do not see how this counts the gauge sets. My
generating function for $G_{2n}$, the number of gauge sets
(eq.~(7) in \refref{Cvit77b})  is
\beq
\sum_{n=1}^\infty G_{2n}
    =
      \frac{X}
           {(1+X)(1-X)^{3}}
\,.
\ee{Cvit77b(7)}

Broadhurst, Delbourgo and Kreimer\rf{BrDeKr96} 1996 {\em Unknotting the
polarized vacuum of quenched {QED}} unearthes much knot-theory magic,
leading to cancelations of ``transcedentals.'' That might be another
route to proving the QED is finite - if there is some finite knot-theory
basis for expressing the value of every gauge set, and the gauge
invariance induced cancelations are so strong to lead to the large
cancelations of transcendentals (hyperlogarithms), then perhaps that
gives bounds on the size of each gauge set which are slower than
combinatorial. The number of different kinds of knots with $n$ crossings
is known to grow only exponentially, not faster.

Henry Ki{\ss}ler (on \refpage{sect:Hepp}) has a fresh idea for how to
approach the finiteness conjecture, using the \emph{Hepp bound}.

Note that the Ki{\ss}ler and Kreimer\rf{KisKre16} definition of a ``gauge
set'' differs from \refeq{quenchAnom} used here. They organize a
gauge-dependent calculation into ``gauge sets'' of different parameter
dependence.

My notes on these papers are below, starting on \refpage{sect:BrDeKr96}.

\section{Method of smooth conjugacies}
\label{sect:scfpo}

% \item[2017-06-27 Predrag]
Cvitanovi\'{c}\rf{chfield}
{\em {Chaotic Field Theory}: {A} sketch}
% ~predrag/articles/hongkong/hk.tex
is an overview over three approaches to incorporating weak noise
corrections into periodic orbit theory, the classical, deterministic
theory that describes nonlinear systems in chaotic (for low-dimensional
systems) or turbulent (for PDEs) regime.

The effects of weak noise are of interest in their own right, as any
deterministic evolution that occurs in nature is affected by noise.
However, what motivated the work\rf{noisy_Fred,conjug_Fred,diag_Fred}
summarized in this paper is the fact that the form of perturbative
corrections for the stochastic problem  is the same as for the quantum
problem, and still the actual calculations are sufficiently simple that
one can explore many more orders in perturbation theory than would be
possible for a full-fledged field theory, and develop new perturbative
methods.

The first method is the standard Feynman-diagrammatic expansion. For
semiclassical quantum mechanics of a classically chaotic system such
calculation was first carried out by Gaspard\rf{GasAlo93}. The stochastic
version, implemented by Dettmann\rf{noisy_Fred}, reveals features not so
readily apparent in the quantum calculation. Perhaps some of that
could be of interest to Kreimer and collaborators, \refsect{sect:HopfAlgebra}.

The Feynman diagram method becomes unwieldy at higher orders. The second
method, introduced by Vattay\rf{diag_Fred}, is based on Rugh's\rf{hhrugh92}
explicit matrix representation of the {\evOper}. If one is interested in
evaluating numerically many orders of perturbation theory and many
eigenvalues, this method is unsurpassed.

The third approach, the smooth conjugations introduced by
Mainieri\rf{conjug_Fred}, is the most elegant one, and perhaps an
altogether new idea in field theory.
Mainieri asked: as the dynamics is
nonlinear, why not search for a nonlinear field transformation
$\field = h(\tilde{\field})$ (a smooth conjugacy) that
makes the intrinsic coordinates as simple as possible? Schematically,
wrong in the detail, but right in spirit, find a smooth conjugacy
such that the action $S[\field] = S_0[\field] + S_I[\field]$ in the
partition function path integral
becomes the free, quadratic action,
\beq
Z %[\source]
	 =  e^{W} %[\source]}
\,=\, \int [d\field] e^{S[\field]} % + \field \cdot \source}
\,=\, \int [d\tilde{\field}]
      \frac{1}{|\det \partial h(\tilde{\field})|^{1 \over 2}} \, e^{S_0[\tilde{\field}]}
\label{Z-J}
\eeq
but at the price of having a determinant of the
conjugacy Jacobian show up as a weight.

In this approach the neighborhood of each saddlepoint is rectified by an
appropriate nonlinear field transformation, with the focus shifted from
the dynamics in the original field variables to the properties of the
conjugacy transformation. The expressions obtained \emph{correspond to sums}
of Feynman diagrams, but are more compact.




\subsection{Worldline formalism}
\label{sect:worldline}

How and why Feynman in 1950 introduced `worldline formalism' (initially
for scalar QED, appendix to \refref{Feynman50}, then for spinor QED,
appendix to \refref{Feynman51}) is explained in Schubert 2001
report\rf{Schubert01} (which also has an extensive bibliography up to
2001).
In 1982 Affleck, Alvarez, and Manton\rf{AffAlMa82} used the Feynman
worldline path integral representation of the quenched effective action
for scalar QED in the constant electric field, and, independently,
Lebedev and Ritus\rf{LebRit84} did the same for the spinor QED in 1984.

A formula for the charged scalar propagator to emit and reabsorb $N$
photons as it propagates from $x'$ to $x$ can be derived
as follows\rf{AhBaSc16}.
The free scalar propagator for the Euclidean
Klein-Gordon equation\rf{Schubert12,AhBaSc16} is
\beq
D_0(x,x')=\bra{x}\frac{1}{-\Box +m^2}\ket{x'}
\,,
\ee{Schubert12(1.1)}
where $\Box$ is the $D$-dimensional Laplacian. Exponentiate the
denominator following Schwinger,
% proper-time parameter $T$
\beq
D_0(x,x')=\int_0^\infty\!\!dT\,{e}^{-m^2T}\bra{x}e^{-T(-\Box)}\ket{x'}
\,,
\ee{Schubert12(1.4)}
Replace the operator in the exponent by a path integral
\beq
D_0(x,x')=\int_0^\infty\!\!dT\,e^{-m^2T}
\int_{x(0)=x'}^{x(T)=x}\!\!\!\!\mathcal{D}x(\tau)\,
    e^{-\int_0^T\!\!d\tau \frac{1}{4}\dot{x}^2}
\,,
\ee{Schubert12(1.7)}
where $\tau$ is a proper-time parameter. This is the \emph{worldline path
integral} representation of the relativistic propagator of a scalar
particle in Euclidean spacetime. It\, is easily evaluated and leads to
the usual space and momentum space free propagators. Adding the QED
interaction terms leads to the Feynman's worldline path integral
representation\rf{Feynman50} of the charged scalar propagator  of mass
$m$ in the presence of a background field $A(x)$,
\beq
D(x,x')=\int_0^\infty\!\!dT\,e^{-m^2T}
    \int_{x(0)=x'}^{x(T)=x}\!\!\mathcal{D}x(\tau)\,
            {e}^{-S_0-S_e-S_i}
\,,
\ee{AhBaSc16(1)}
where (0) is the free propagation
\beq
S_0 = \int_0^T\!\!d\tau \frac{1}{4}\dot{x}^2
\,,
\ee{Ahmadiniaz1}
(e) is the interaction of the charged scalar with the external field
\beq
S_e = -ie\int_0^T\!\!d\tau\,\dot{x}^\mu A_\mu(x(\tau))
\,,
\ee{Ahmadiniaz2}
and (i) are the virtual photons exchanged along the charged particle's
trajectory
\beq
S_i = \frac{e^2}{2}\int_0^T\!\!d\tau_1\int_0^T\!\!d\tau_2\,
      \dot{x}_1^\mu\,D_{\mu\nu}(x_1-x_2)\,\dot{x}_2^\nu
\,,
\ee{Ahmadiniaz3}
where $D_{\mu\nu} $ is the $x$-space photon propagator.
% In $D$ dimensions and arbitrary covariant gauge

Consider first the charged scalar field in external field, neglecting
internal photon loops. By taking the constant external field $A(x)$ to be
a sum of $N$ plane waves, one obtains the rule for inserting $N$ external
photons:
\bea
D_{(N)}(x,x')
%\langle 0|T \phi (x) \phi (y) |0\rangle_{(N)}
&=& (-\lambda)^N
 \int_0^\infty \! dT \,e^{-m^2 T}
 \int_0^Td\tau_1 \cdots \int_0^Td\tau_N
 \nonumber\\ &&
\times  \int_{_{x(0)=y}}^{^{\, x(T)=x}}
\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\! {\cal D}x
\,e^{i\sum_{i=1}^Nk_i\cdot x(\tau_i)}
e^{ -\int_0^Td\tau\, {1\over 4} \dot x^2}
\,.
\label{Nprop}
\eea
For the spinor case, the magnetic moment will be given by the term linear
in a constant external field $A(x)$, and in order to define gauge sets,
one will have to distinguish the in- and out-electron lines.

The object of great interest to us is the quenched internal virtual
photons term \refeq{Ahmadiniaz3}:
\beq
\int_{x(0)=x'}^{x(T)=x}\!\!\mathcal{D}x(\tau)\,
            {e}^{-S_i}
=
\int_{x(0)=x'}^{x(T)=x}\!\!\mathcal{D}x(\tau)\,
            {e}^{-\frac{e^2}{2}\int_0^T\!\!d\tau_1\int_0^T\!\!d\tau_2\,
      \dot{x}_1^\mu\,D_{\mu\nu}(x_1-x_2)\,\dot{x}_2^\nu}
\,.
\ee{AhBaSc16(1)i}
(Fried and Gabellini\rf{FriGab13} refer to this as the ``linkage
operator''). Expanded perturbatively in $\alpha/\pi$, this yields the
usual Feynman-parametric vertex diagrams. However, it is Gaussian in
$\dot{x}^\mu$, and if by integration by parts, $\dot{x}^\mu$ are
eliminated in favor of $x^\mu$, internal photons can be integrated over
directly, prior to an expansion in $(\alpha/\pi)^n$, and one gets
integrals in terms of \emph{$N$-photon propagators}, symmetrized sums over $N$
photons, and not the usual
vertex graphs. Each usual vertex graph corresponds to one particular
permutation of internal photon insertions, and from that comes the
factorial growth in the number of graphs.

These integrations by parts lead to the first and second proper-time
derivatives of the Green's function, worked out in the literature (for
example, in \refrefs{Strassler92,Schubert12}), the details would take too
much space to recap here. I find Bastianelli, Huet, Schubert, Thakur and
Weber 2014 paper\rf{BHSTW14} quite inspirational.
 My notes on these papers are below, around
\refpage{sect:SchSch96}.
Apologies, my notes are just a jumble, jottings taken as I try to
understand this literature. They might be useful anyway, as pointers to
the literature.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Thus, for the quenched scalar QED, the worldline integrals are expressed
in terms of $N$-photon propagators, the central ingredient that defines
the quenched gauge sets \refeq{quenchAnom}.
Unlike the Feynman parameter integrals for individual vertex graphs, they are
independent of the ordering of the momenta $k_1,\ldots,k_N$; the formula
\refeq{AhBaSc16(1)i} contains all $\approx N!$ ways of attaching the $N$
photons to the charged particle propagator.
The formulation combines combinatorially many Feynman diagrams into a single integral.
An example are the quenched contributions to the
three-loop photon propagator shown in \reffig{BHSTW143loopphotonprop}.

In QED the $N$-photon propagator formulation combines into one integral
all Feynman graphs related by permutations of photon legs along fermion
lines, that is, it should yield \emph{one} integral for a gauge set
$(k,m,m')$ defined in \refeq{quenchAnom}.
%, provided one may distinguish the leg-photons from the cross-photons.

\subsection{High-orders QED in worldline formalism}
\label{sect:highQEDworldline}

A non-perturbative formula for QED in a constant field, given for scalar
QED in 1982 by Affleck, Alvarez, and Manton\rf{AffAlMa82}, and for spinor
QED by Lebedev and Ritus\rf{LebRit84} in 1984, is an example how the
worldline formalism can yield high-order information on QED amplitudes.
Huet, McKeon, and Schubert\rf{HuMcSc10} continue this in their 2010
%{\em {Euler-Heisenberg} lagrangians and asymptotic analysis in 1+1 {QED.
% Part I: Two}-loop}
%(no GaTech online access, \arXiv{1010.5315}):``
study of the l-electron loop, $N$-photon amplitudes in the limit of large
photon numbers and low photon energies, this time for 1+1 dimensional
scalar QED, in order to illustrate the large cancellations inside gauge
invariant classes of graphs.

Affleck \etal\rf{AffAlMa82} use the Feynman\rf{Feynman50} `worldline
path integral' representation of the quenched effective action for scalar
QED in the constant electric field, and calculate the amplitude in a
stationary path approximation. The stationary trajectory so obtained is a
circle with a field dependent radius, called ``instanton''  in this
context. The worldline action on this trajectory yields the correct
exponent, and the second variation determinant yields the correct  prefactor.
Using Borel analysis, they obtain non-perturbative information on the
on-shell renormalized $N$-photon amplitudes at large $N$ and low energies.

For the quenched spinor QED (fermion lines decorated by photon exchanges)
closed-form expressions for general $N$ require the worldline
super-\,formalism\rf{Schubert01}, at the cost of introducing Fradkin
1966\rf{Fradkin66} Grassmann path integral,
or, alternatively,
the second order
formalism of Strassler\rf{Strassler92}.

The 2006 Dunne and Schubert\rf{DunSch06} study of scalar and spinor QED
$N$-photon amplitudes, in the quenched approximation (\ie, taking only
the diagrams with one electron loop) led to ``the following
generalization of Cvitanovi\'c's conjecture: the perturbation series
converges for all on-shell renormalized QED amplitudes at leading order
in $N_f$. It must be emphasized that the on-shell renormalization is
essential in all of the above.''
Unlike Cvitanovi\'c\rf{Cvit77b} purely numerical conjecture, theirs is a
sophisticated argument, buttressed by Borel dispersion relations.

\noindent
Currently Sergey  A. Volkov is in the best position to check the QED
finiteness conjecture numerically, by computing the 5-loops gauge sets.

Worldline formalism could be useful on a qualitative level, as a way of
proving the finiteness of QED conjecture,
    \begin{enumerate}
  \item
Develop a saddle point expansion for the $N$-photon propagator
integrals, such that the
leading term explains the apparent $\approx \pm 1/2$ (or a multiple
thereof) size of each quenched gauge set. Affleck \etal\rf{AffAlMa82}
show the way.
  \item
Use that to establish bounds on gauge sets for large orders, prove
finiteness of quenched QED. If that works, I trust electron loop
insertions will be next, and thereafter renormalons\rf{Lautrup77}, \etc,
will go \HREF{https://soundcloud.com/poets-org/notgogentle-mp3-5/s-2o7zI}
{gently into that good night}.
    \end{enumerate}
and in a precise way, as a new computational tool:
    \begin{enumerate}
  \item
Develop a new worldline formulation of QED in which each gauge set is
given by a computable integral. Parenthetically, a reformulation of the
self-energy diagrams magnetic moment calculation would be an even greater
saving - all quenched diagrams contributions calculated at one go. A new
worldline formulation might make it possible to evaluate orders beyond
5-loops, as the number of gauge sets grows only polynomially. A win-win.
  \item
To proceed, one needs something like a Bern-Kosower\rf{BerKos91} type
master formula for the electron line dressed with any number of photons,
with a single constant external (arbitrarily weak) field insertion.
Schubert \etal\ have it (unpublished). For
the magnetic moment calculation, the external vertex is distinguished by
its
\(
\sigma^{\mu\nu}={1\over 2}[\gamma^{\mu},\gamma^{\nu}]
\)
form, while all internal, virtual photon vertices are of the usual
$\gamma^{\mu}$ form. For an introduction to the conventional
magnetic moment calculation, see for example
my QFT course, lectures 25 and 26
\HREF{http://chaosbook.org/~predrag/courses/PHYS-7147-13/schedule.xml}
{here})
  \item
Hopefully the distinction motivates the  gauge set sign rule
\refeq{Cvit77b(5)}. Keep in mind, however, that this empirical rule is
already violated by the gauge set $(2,2,0)$).
  \item
As the external vertex transfers a (vanishing) momentum, the
incoming and outgoing electron on-mass shell legs are distinct, and thus
there are three kinds of $N$-photon propagators; $k$ photons crossing the
external vertex (cross-photons) and $m [m']$ photons originating and
terminating on the incoming [outgoing] electron leg (leg-photons). One
that needs to prove in the worldline formalism that each $(k,m,m')$
integral (corresponding to a set of quenched set of 1-particle
irreducible Feynman vertex diagrams without electron loops) is separately
(i) a gauge-invariant set, and
(ii) the minimal gauge invariant set.
  \item
The first thing to verify is that the worldline $(1,0,0)$ integral
reproduces Schwinger's $\frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{\alpha}{\pi}\right)$
result\rf{Schwinger48}, exactly. That is an exercise in converting the
integral into Feynman-parametric form, already done several times for
other amplitudes.
  \item
Next, reformulate the 2-loop calculation as two worldline integrals.
There are only 2 quenched gauge sets $(k,m,m')$:  $(2,0,0)$ and
$(1,1,0)$, which equals $(1,0,1)$ by time reversal,
see \reffig{Cvit77bFig1} and \reffig{tabGaugeSets}. No need to
evaluate these analytically (though Laporta, Kreimer, \etc,
would be interested to see whether some simplification occurs),
main thing is to understand that the UV renormalization works,
and that there are no intermediate IR divergences in this
reformulation.
  \item
One electron-loop insertion into $(1,0,0)$  might be the easiest to
evaluate, but I find the quenched sets a higher priority.
  \item
Things get interesting with reformulating the quenched 3-loop calculation
as four worldline integrals / gauge sets, see \reffig{Cvit77bFig3} and
\reffig{tabGaugeSets}. In particular, the fermion line attachments of
different kinds of $N$-photon propagators now get intertwined.
  \item
One photon-photon scattering electron-loop insertion into $(2,0,0)$ might
be the most tempting to evaluate, but I find the quenched sets a higher
priority.
  \item
A renormalization question:
A gauge set is by definition UV and IR finite. Does that mean
that its worldline formalism integrand is pointwise finite, no need for
counterterms?
    \end{enumerate}
My main problem at the moment (well, there are many:) is that nobody
seems to have written an explicit formula for the spinor QED anomalous
magnetic moment in the worldline formalism.
