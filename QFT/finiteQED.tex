%\item[2017-04-28
In 2017 Laporta\rf{Laporta17,Laporta18} completed the twenty-year
project of computing analytically the individual contributions
of 891 4-loop vertex diagrams contributing to the electron
magnetic moment $g$. Vertex diagrams separate
in 25 gauge sets (see \reffig{Laporta17figuragau}).
The numerical contribution of each set is
listed in \reftab{Laporta17:tableset}.
Adding only the quenched set $V$ diagrams (diagrams with no lepton
loops, see \reffig{Cvit77bFig3} %\reftab{tabGaugeSets}
and \ref{Laporta17figuragauShort}), one
finds for the 4- and 5-loop contributions to the anomaly
$a[V]=\left.\frac{1}{2}(g-2)\right|_V$:
\bea
 a^{(8)}[V] &=& -2.176866027739540077443259355895893938670

There is a prediction dating back to 1977 for values of these terms: the
predicted $a^{(8)}[V] \approx 0$ does not pan out,
but the difference is small, considering that this
is a sum of 518 vertex diagrams (or 47 self-energy
diagrams)\rf{KinLin90}.
Likewise, the prediction for $a^{(10)}[V]$ is not too far off, considering
that this is a sum of 6\,354 vertex diagrams of \reftab{Cvit77bTab1} (or
389 self-energy diagrams).

\section{Electron magnetic moment}
\label{sect:magMom}

\noindent
% pasted from BAGTB17
This section sets up the notation - the reader can safely skip it and
start with \refsect{sect:finitness}. For an introduction to the
conventional magnetic moment calculation, see for example the
Cvitanovi\'c online graduate QFT course, lectures 25 and 26
\HREF{http://chaosbook.org/~predrag/courses/PHYS-7147-13/schedule.xml}
{here}.

An electron of mass $m$  has a magnetic moment
\beq
\mu=\frac{e\hbar}{2mc}\,\frac{g}{2}
\ee{Laporta18(1)}
where $g$ is the gyromagnetic ratio.
In Dirac theory\rf{Dirac28}, the electron has $g=2$.

Consider the electron-photon vertex $\Gamma_{\mu}$ of quantum
electrodynamics, with $p_{i}=p-q/2$ and $p_{o}=p+q/2$ the momenta of
incoming and outgoing electron lines, evaluated on the electron mass
shell $p_{i}^2=p_{o}^2=m^2$.
By Gordon decomposition the vertex can be written in terms of the Dirac
and Pauli form factors $F_1(q^2)$ and $F_2(q^2)$:
\beq
\overline{u}(p_{o}) \Gamma_{\mu}(p,q) %\Big|_{k^2=p^2=m^2}
u(p_{i})
    =    %    && \hspace{-4.5cm}
\overline{u}(p_{o}) \Bigg\{ F_1(q^2) \gamma_{\mu} -
\frac{F_2 (q^2)}{2m} \; \sigma_{\mu \nu} q^{\nu} \Bigg\} u(p_{i}) \,,
\label{BAGTB17(35-1)}
\eeq
where the spinors  $\overline{u}(p_{i})$ and $u(p_{i})$  satisfy the Dirac
equation:
\[
\overline{u}(p_{o}) \not\!{p}_{o} = m \, \overline{u}(p_{o})
\,, \qquad
\not\!{p}_{i} \, u(p_{i})  =  m \, u(p_{i}) \,.
\]
We follow the notation of Bjorken and Drell\rf{BjoDre65}
and Cvitanovi{\'c} and Kinoshita\rf{CviKin74c}.
$Z_1$,
$Z_2$, and % = (1-B)^{-1}$, and
$Z_3$,
are the respectively the vertex,
the electron wave function, and
the photon wave function
renormalization constants,
and the electron mass will be set to $m = 1$ throughout.
In what follows it is convenient to define $Z_1=1+L$.
For QED the charge conservation requires that the renormalized charge
form factor satisfies $\tilde{F}_1(0) = 1$, which is guaranteed by the
Ward identity\rf{Ward50}
$Z_1=Z_2$.
%The renormalized $\tilde{\Gamma}^{\nu}(p,q)$ and unrenormalized
%$\Gamma^{\nu}(p,q)$
%proper vertex are related by the electron wave function renormalization constant
%\beq
%\tilde{\Gamma}^{\nu} =Z_2 \Gamma^{\nu} = \Gamma^{\nu}/(1-B)
%\,.
%\ee{PRD10-74-III(2.1)}
The vertex renormalization constant $L$ is given by the
on-shell value of the unrenormalized charge form factor\rf{BroSul67,IsNaYa19}
    \PC{2018-11-26
    Brodsky and Sullivan\rf{BroSul67} is not an obvious reference - they
    just state the trace formulas, no derivation or attribution.
    Ishikawa, Nakazawa and Yasui\rf{IsNaYa19} eq.~(8) simply refers to
    ``Cvitanovi\'c-Kinoshita procedure''\rf{CviKin74a,CviKin74b}.
    }
\beq
1+L = F_1(0)
    = \frac{1}{4}\tr\left[(\not\!{p}+1)p^{\nu}\Gamma^{\nu}\right]_{q=0}
\label{PRD10-74-III(2.3)}
\,,
\eeq
and  $a = (g-2)/2$, the anomalous magnetic moment of an electron is
given by the static limit of the magnetic form factor
$a=\tilde{F}_2(0)=M/(1+L)$, where\rf{BroSul67}
\beq
M = \lim_{q\to0}
% \frac{1}{4p^4q^2} % simplified by P^2=1
\frac{1}{4q^2}
\tr\left\{
\left[\gamma^{\nu}p^2-(1+q^2/2)p^{\nu}\right]
(\not\!{p}_o+1)\Gamma_{\nu}(\not\!{p}_i+1)
\right\}
\label{PRD10-74-III(2.2)}
\,.
\eeq
The perturbative expansions for the
magnetic moment anomaly is defined as %\rf{CviKin74c}
\beq
a = \frac{M(\alpha_0)}{1+L(\alpha_0)}
  =  \sum_{n=1}^\infty
          a_{0}^{(2n)}\left(\frac{\alpha_0}{\pi}\right)^{n}
\,,
\ee{IRstruct(1)}
where $1+L =F_1(0)$, $M=F_2(0)$ are computed from the unrenormalized
proper vertex \refeq{BAGTB17(35-1)}, given by the sum of all one-particle
irreducible electron-electron-photon vertex diagrams with internal
photons, electron loops and electron mass counterterms.
Expanding $M$ and $L$ we have
\bea
a_{0}^{(2)} &=& M^{(2)}
            \continue
a_{0}^{(4)} &=& M^{(4)} - L^{(2)}M^{(2)}
            \label{PRD10-74-III(2.6)}\\
a_{0}^{(6)} &=& M^{(6)} - L^{(2)}M^{(4)} - (L^{(4)} - (L^{(2)})^2) M^{(2)}
\nnu
\eea

As shown in \refref{IRstruct}, for the anomaly \refeq{IRstruct(1)}
expressed in terms of the unrenormalized coupling constant $\alpha_0$,
all $a_{0}^{(n)}$ are IR finite, for both QED and QCD.
The UV finite expression for the anomaly \refeq{IRstruct(1)} is obtained
by the charge renormalization
\beq
\alpha=Z\alpha_0
\,,\qquad
Z= \frac{Z_2}{Z_1}\,Z_3
\,,
\ee{IRstruct(3)}
where
$Z_1$,
$Z_2$, and
$Z_3$
%renormalization constants
are computed as power series in the bare coupling constant $\alpha_0$.
For QED $Z_1=Z_2$ by the Ward identity\rf{Ward50}, and for QCD the $Z_i$'s are
related by the Taylor-Slavnov\rf{Taylor71,Slavnov72} identities
\refeq{IRstruct(3)}. The simple structure of \refeq{IRstruct(1)} and
\refeq{PRD10-74-III(2.6)} should simplify the worldline calculations of
\refsect{sect:magMomWorldline}.

The Dirac equation predicts that the magnetic moment of an
electron of charge $e$ and mass $m$ is ${ {\mu}} = {e}/{2 m} $,
\ie, in the absence of radiative corrections
$\tilde{F}_1(0)=1$ and $\tilde{F}_2(0)=0$. In 1948 Schwinger\rf{Schwinger48} showed that in
the leading, one-loop order in the fine structure constant $\alpha$, the
radiative corrections lead to the anomalous magnetic moment of form
$\tilde{F}_2(0)={\alpha}/{2\pi}+ a^{(2)}\left({\alpha}/{\pi}\right)^2 +
\cdots$
(the result engraved on Schwinger's
\HREF{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julian_Schwinger\#/media/File:Julian_Schwinger_headstone.JPG}
{tombstone}).
%\[
% \frac{e}{2 m} \Rightarrow
% \left( 1 + \frac{1}{2} \left(\frac{\alpha}{\pi}\right) \right) \frac{e}{2 m}.
%\]
These notes are about what to expect for the $\left({\alpha}/{\pi}\right)^n$
term in this series.

In 1972 Toichiro Kinoshita and Predrag Cvitanovi\'c had completed
computing a large number of 3-loop anomalous magnetic moment Feynman
diagrams and regularization counterterms\rf{CviKin72},
\reffig{JegNif09fig10}.
The subsequent 4- and 5-loop numerical and analytic calculations were
nothing short of heroic\rf{KinLin90,LapRem96,Laporta17,AoHaKiNi15,Volkov19}. The
quantum field theory was used in the standard way\rf{BjoDre65}, by
expanding the magnetic moment into combinatorially many Feynman diagrams
(see the numbers of vertex graphs in \reftab{Cvit77bTab1}).
Each Feynman diagram corresponds to an integral in many dimensions, with
oscillatory integrand with thousands of terms, each integral separately
UV divergent, IR divergent, and unphysical, as its value depends on the
definition of counterterms and the choice of gauge.
The numerical values of these integrals typically range from  $\pm 10$
to $\pm 100$. For example, the largest contributions of
the 389 quenched self-energy diagrams listed in
Aoyama \etal\ 2018\rf{AoKiNi18} are of order $\pm 20$.

Adding up hundreds of such contributions, of wildly fluctuating values,
yields (for the no-fermion loops subset $V$, in the notation of
\refref{AoHaKiNi15})
\[
 a^{(6)}[V] %\aql{6}
 \,=\, +  (0.92 \pm 0.02) \left(\frac{\alpha}{\pi}\right)^3.
\]
But why ``+'' and not ``-''? Why so small? Why does a sum of hundreds of
diagrams and counterterms yield a number of order of unity, and not 10 or
100 or any other number?

If gauge invariance of QED guarantees that all UV and on-mass shell IR
divergences cancel, could it be that it also enforces cancellations among
the finite parts of contributions of different Feynman graphs?

\subsection{QED vertex photons come in three ``colors''}
\label{sect:gaugeSetDeriv}

As first noted by Lautrup, Peterman and de Rafael\rf{LaPeRa72}, the
renormalized on-mass shell QED vertex diagrams separate into a sum of
minimal gauge-invariant subsets, each subset separately UV and IR finite.
The only published proof of this elementary fact seems to be
\refref{Cvit77b}. The very reasonably priced \refref{FieldThe} might be
worth a read, especially if one is interested in the non-abelian
theories as well\rf{MassShell,IRstruct,QCDmshell},
see \refsect{sect:QCDgaugeSets}.

A gauge change generates a $k^\mu$ term in a photon propagator,
and that affects a tree electron vertex in a very simple way,
\(
\slashed{k} = (\slashed{p}+\slashed{k}+m) - (\slashed{p}+m)
\,,
\)
or, diagrammatically\rf{BjoDre65,FieldThe} (graphs drawn by H.
Ki{\ss}ler\rf{KisKre16}),
\PC{2017-07-14

  \begin{tabular}{ccccc}
$\!{\begin{aligned}\frac{1}{\slashed{p}+\slashed{k}-m}\slashed{k}\frac{1}{\slashed{p}-m}\end{aligned}}$ &
$=$ &    $\!{\begin{aligned}\frac{1}{\slashed{p}-m}\end{aligned}}$ &
$-$ &    $\!{\begin{aligned}\frac{1}{\slashed{p}+\slashed{k}-m},\end{aligned}}$
\\
$\treeA{.45}$ & $=$ & $\treeB{.45}$ & $-$ & $\treeC{.45}$.
  \end{tabular}
  \label{KisKre16eq:treeLevel1}
\end{align}

To simplify matters, in what follows we shall consider only the
no-fermion loop diagrams, or `quenched-', or `q-type' diagrams
(`quenched', as this corresponds to the $N_f$-independent part of the
vertex amplitude in
QED with $N_f$ flavors).
The minimal gauge-invariant subsets without electron loops (see
\reffig{JegNif09fig10} diagrams $\{23-72\}$; \reffig{Cvit77bFig1};
\ref{Cvit77bFig2}; \ref{Cvit77bFig3}; and \ref{Laporta17figuragauShort})
will be hereafter be referred to as \emph{gauge sets}.

A quenched QED gauge set $(k,m,m')$ consists of all 1-particle irreducible vertex
diagrams without electron loops, with $k$ photons crossing the external
vertex (cross-photons) and $m [m']$ photons originating and terminating
on the incoming [outgoing] electron leg (leg-photons), where $m\geq m'$.
For asymmetric pairs of sets, with $m\neq m'$, the contribution to the
anomaly $a_{kmm'}$ is, in the convention of \refref{Cvit77b}, the sum of
the set and its mirror (time-reversed) image,
\beq
a[V]=\left.\frac{1}{2}(g-2)\right|_V
       =  \sum_{k=1}^\infty\sum_{m=0}^\infty\sum_{m'=0}^m
          a_{kmm'}\left(\frac{\alpha}{\pi}\right)^{k+m+m'}
\,.
\ee{quenchAnom}

\subsection{The unreasonable smallness of gauge sets}
\label{sect:gaugeSetsSmall}

When the diagrams computed in \refref{CviKin74c} are grouped into
gauge sets, \reffig{Cvit77bFig1} to \reffig{Laporta17figuragauShort},
a surprising thing happens; while the
finite part of each Feynman diagram is of order of 10 to 100, every
 gauge set known at the time added up to approximately
$$
		   \pm {1 \over 2} \left(\frac{\alpha}{\pi}\right)^n
\,,
$$
with the sign given by a simple empirical rule
\beq
a_{kmm'} = (-1)^{m+m'}\frac{1}{2}
\,.
\ee{Cvit77b(5)}
The sign rule is further corroborated by sets with photon
self-energy insertions (but with the absolute size scaled down to
$3-15\%$ of \refeq{Cvit77b(5)}).
In \reffig{Cvit77bFig3} this rule is compared with the actual numbers,
and the 1977 four-loop prediction is given\rf{Cvit77b}.
With that prediction, the ``zeroth'' order estimate of the electron
magnetic moment anomaly $a$ is given by the ``gauge-set
approximation,'' convergent and summable to all orders
\beq
a=\frac{1}{2}(g-2) =  \frac{1}{2} \frac{\alpha}{\pi}
                     \frac{1}
           {\left( 1 - \left(\frac{\alpha}{\pi}\right)^2
			\right)^2
		      } + \mbox{``corrections"}
\,.
\ee{Cvit77b(1)}
This is not how one usually thinks of perturbation theory. Most of our
colleagues believe that in 1952 Dyson\rf{Dyson52} had  shown that the
perturbation expansion is an asymptotic series (for a discussion, see
Dunne and Schubert\rf{DunSch06,HuTrSc17a}), in the sense that the $n$-th order
contribution should be exploding combinatorially
$$
{1 \over 2} (g-2) \approx
\cdots + n^n \left(\frac{\alpha}{\pi}\right)^n + \cdots
\,,
$$
and not growing slowly like my estimate
\[
{1 \over 2} (g-2) \approx
\cdots + \frac{n}{2}\left(\frac{\alpha}{\pi}\right)^{2n} + \cdots
\,.
\]
For me, the above is the most intriguing hint that something deeper than
what we know today underlies quantum field theory, and the most suggestive
lesson of our calculation.

\subsection{Self-energy sets}
\label{sect:selfEnergy}

There are two ways of grouping vertex diagrams, into \emph{gauge sets},
and into \emph{self-energy sets} (or the ``externally gauge-invariant''
sets). Every vertex diagram belongs both to a gauge set and to a
self-energy set, as illustrated by \reffig{Cvit77bFig2}.
Formulation of the $(g-2)$ computation directly from self-energy graphs
is due to
\HREF{http://chaosbook.org/~predrag/papers/preprints.html\#PerturbativeQED}
{Cvitanovi\'{c} and Kinoshita}, see the ``new formula'' (6.22) in
\refref{CviKin74c}. Not only does this calculation use fewer Feynman
graphs, but it enables calculation of the 3-loop electron magnetic moment
by two independent methods (and in this way helps track down and
eliminate errors in either calculation). As an important aside,
Carroll\rf{CarYao74, Carroll75} gives the credit for self-energy sets
only to the mass-operator formalism of Schwinger\rf{Schwinger51a,
Schwinger51b, Schwinger51c, Sommerfield58}, even though Carroll papers
look closer to \refref{CviKin74c} than to Schwinger and Sommerfield;
\refref{CviKin74c} is cited, and his derivation is also based on the
Ward-Takahashi identity\rf{Ward50,Takahashi57}. The self-energy set
formulation might be equivalent to Schwinger's, but it looks quite
different in detail, and the authors were not aware of Schwinger
mass-operator when they derived it.

The gauge sets are minimal, and separately gauge invariant (for a proof,
see \refref{Cvit77b}). The self-energy sets are not, only their sum is
gauge invariant.
Unlike gauge sets, whose number grows polynomially, the number of
self-energy sets grows combinatorially - they save significant amount
of computing for few-loops computations, but cannot be used to argue the
finiteness of QED.
That is the reason why Aoyama \etal\rf{AoHaKiNi12,AoHaKiNi15,AoKiNi18}
calculations have nothing to say about the 1977 conjecture\rf{Cvit77b}:
they do not compute individual vertex diagrams, but only the self-energy
sets, and for them the set of all diagrams without a fermion loop
(`quenched-' or `q-type' diagrams) is a single `gauge set'
$V$. For example, for 5-loops the set $V$ is a sum of 9 vertex gauge sets
(where time-reversed pairs count as one set, see \reftab{tabGaugeSets}),
but Aoyama \etal\rf{AoKiNi18} only give their sum \refeq{anomalValues}.

Aoyama \etal\ 5-loop calculations already push the envelope of what is
numerically attainable, they cannot switch from the self-energy
diagrams formulation to the vertex diagrams formulation, it would mean
(for the quenched set $V$) going from 389 self-energy graphs to 6\,354
vertex diagrams. Stefano Laporta deserves a bit of well earned rest. So
what is ahead?

At this time, Sergey  A. Volkov appears to be the
only person set up do the requisite 5-loop calculations,
see \refsect{sect:Volkov}.

Two approaches might be relevant to
establishing bounds on, and perhaps even the direct computation
of gauge sets (ignoring the $N\!=\!2$ and $N\!=\!4$
supersymmetric models):
(1)
\emph{worldline formalism} pursued by
\HREF{http://www.ifm.umich.mx/ifm/index.php/fisca/academicos/schubert/}
{Schubert} and collaborators,
see \refsect{sect:worldline},
and
(2)
\emph{Hopf algebraic approach} of Kreimer and collaborators,
see \refsect{sect:HopfAlgebra}.

Very far out in the left field is the smooth conjugacy method of
\refsect{sect:scfpo} which would require a bit of real work to apply it
to a field theory.

\section{Volkov method}
\label{sect:Volkov}

In \refref{Volkov16} Volkov explains that $A_1^{(2n)}$ is free from
infrared divergences since they are removed by the on-shell
renormalization.
However, Volkov also states that there is no universal method in QED for
canceling IR divergences in the Feynman graphs analogous to the R
operation, and that the standard subtractive on-shell renormalization
cannot remove IR divergences point-by-point in Feynman-parametric space,
as it does for UV divergences. Moreover, it can generate additional
IR-divergences.

That QED on-mass shell amplitudes are IR-free must be an old result; even
I have several papers generalizing that to
QCD\rf{MassShell,IRstruct,QCDmshell,NPB81}. Tom Kinoshita and I solved
the problem of point-by-point removal of IR divergences in
Feynman-parametric space in my thesis\rf{CviKin74b}, with a
super-elegant formula (who needs forests?) for the UV and IR finite part
of amplitude $M_G$,
\beq
\Delta M_G =\prod_{ij}(1-I_{G/S_i})(1-K_{G/S_j}) M_G
\,,
\ee{UV-IRfiniteGcorr}
where the products are over all self-energy and vertex subdiagrams $S_i$
and $S_j$.
I have a bright memory of figuring out how to do it one quiet evening in
Ithaca, babysitting for a friend's toddler. But, as Volkov\rf{Volkov16}
and Aoyama \etal\rf{AoHaKiNiWa08} explain, our approach was apparently
not general enough to deal with the 4- and 5-loop contributions.

Volkov's algorithm is developed in {\em New method of computing the
contributions of graphs without lepton loops to the electron anomalous
magnetic moment in {QED}}\rf{Volkov17}. It is based on the ideas used for
proving UV-finiteness of renormalized Feynman
amplitudes\rf{Speer68,AnZaPo73}. He focuses on $n$-loop graphs with no
lepton loops, or, in the notation of these notes, $a^{(2n)}[V]$.
%
Volkov calculation groups Feynman graphs by self-energy graphs families
because they have similar integrand structure. In contrast to
\refrefs{CviKin74c,CarYao74,Carroll75,AoHaKiNi15} he does not evaluate
these self-energy graphs directly; all his calculations are performed
with vertex graphs, \ie, precisely what is needed to evaluate gauge sets
of \refsect{sect:finitness}. However, as illustrated in
\reffig{Cvit77bFig3}, each gauge-set vertex diagram belongs to a
different self-energy diagram, so Volkov calculation will require a major
reorganization of how integrands are generated, requiring months
of recoding.

So far Volkov  has evaluated the ladder graph
%(Figure \ref{fig_ladder})
and the fully crossed graph
%(Figure \ref{fig_crosses})
up to 5 loops. The cross graphs are of interest because they do not
contain divergent subgraphs, so their contributions only depend on the
gauge, but not on the choice of subtraction procedure.

While the contributions of individual vertex graphs (and self-energy
sets\rf{AoHaKiNi15}) are all over the place, all gauge sets are
insanely small up to order 8, and it would be very sweet to see that this
continues through order 10 (at least for the 5-loop graphs with no
electron loops).
My hunch is that starting with the gauge set $(5,0,0)$ of
\reftab{tabGaugeSets} ($5!$ vertex graphs, some of them symmetric pairs)
would be the most rewarding.
Stefano Laporta thinks it too hard, and suggests starting with the 5-loop
relative
$(1,3,1)$ (or $(1,2,2)$) of the 4-loop set $(1,2,1)$,
which would entail less than $5!$ vertex graphs (I have not counted
how many). As no high accuracy is needed, a numerical check of the QED
finiteness conjecture would good enough if the gauge sets evaluated
to two significant digits or so, but even that will need a lot of
computer time.

\section{Hopf algebraic approach}
\label{sect:HopfAlgebra}

Hopf algebraic approach of Kreimer and collaborators\rf{BrDeKr96,
Kreimer00, KreYea08, KisKre16} is very appealing - it is just that I
personally have no clue how to turn it into a direct $(g-2)$ gauge set
calculation. In the 2008 paper\rf{KreYea08}
\HREF{https://www2.mathematik.hu-berlin.de/~kreimer/} {Dirk Kreimer} and
\HREF{https://arxiv.org/find/math-ph,math/1/au:+Yeats_K/0/1/0/all/0/1}
{Karen Yeats} write:
    \begin{quote}
``One case where there is a natural interpretation is QED with a linear
number of generators, namely
\beq
X_1 = 1 + \sum_{k \geq 1}p(k)x^k
      \frac{X_1^{2k+1}}
           {(1-X_2)^{2k}(1-X_3)^{2k}}
\,,
\ee{KreYea08p413}
with $X_2$ and $X_3$ as before and with $p(k)$ linear, which corresponds
to counting with Cvitanovi\'c's gauge invariant sectors\rf{Cvit77b}.''
    \end{quote}
%{\bf 2017-05-31 Predrag}
Even in this simple case I do not see how this counts the gauge sets. My
generating function for $G_{2n}$, the number of gauge sets
(eq.~(7) in \refref{Cvit77b})  is
\beq
\sum_{n=1}^\infty G_{2n}
    =
      \frac{X}
           {(1+X)(1-X)^{3}}
\,.
\ee{Cvit77b(7)}

Broadhurst, Delbourgo and Kreimer\rf{BrDeKr96} 1996 {\em Unknotting the
polarized vacuum of quenched {QED}} unearthes much knot-theory magic,
leading to cancelations of ``transcedentals.'' While their
particular conjecture did not work out
in higher orders, the conceptual scheme might be another
route to proving the QED is finite - if there is some finite knot-theory
basis for expressing the value of every gauge set, and the gauge
invariance induced cancelations are so strong to lead to the large
cancelations of transcendentals (hyperlogarithms), then perhaps that
gives bounds on the size of each gauge set which are slower than
combinatorial. The number of different kinds of knots with $n$ crossings
is known to grow only exponentially, not faster.

Henry Ki{\ss}ler (on \refpage{sect:Hepp}) has a fresh idea for how to
approach the finiteness conjecture, using the \emph{Hepp bound},
see Panzer {\bf 2018-06-07} below.

Note that the Ki{\ss}ler and Kreimer\rf{KisKre16} definition of a ``gauge
set'' differs from \refeq{quenchAnom} used here. They organize a
gauge-dependent calculation into ``gauge sets'' of different parameter
dependence.

My notes on these papers are below, starting on \refpage{sect:BrDeKr96}.

\noindent
Currently Sergey  A. Volkov is in the best position to check the QED
finiteness conjecture numerically, by computing the 5-loops gauge sets.

Worldline formalism could be useful on a qualitative level, as a way of
proving the finiteness of QED conjecture,
    \begin{enumerate}
  \item
Develop a saddle point expansion for the $N$-photon propagator
integrals, such that the
leading term explains the apparent $\approx \pm 1/2$ (or a multiple
thereof) size of each quenched gauge set. Affleck \etal\rf{AffAlMa82}
and G. Torgrimsson \etal\rf{TSOS17} show the way.
  \item
Use that to establish bounds on gauge sets for large orders, prove
finiteness of quenched QED. If that works, I trust electron loop
insertions will be next, and thereafter renormalons\rf{Lautrup77}, \etc,
will go \HREF{https://soundcloud.com/poets-org/notgogentle-mp3-5/s-2o7zI}
{gently into that good night}.
    \end{enumerate}
and in a precise way, as a new computational tool:
    \begin{enumerate}
  \item
Develop a worldline formulation of spinor QED in which each gauge set is
given by a computable integral, in a way to be fleshed out in
\refsect{sect:magMomWorldline}.
  \item
Parenthetically, a reformulation of the self-energy diagrams magnetic
moment calculation, \refsect{sect:selfEnergy}, would be an even greater
computational time saver - all quenched diagrams contributions calculated
at one go.
  \item
In either case, a
worldline formulation might make it possible to evaluate orders beyond
5-loops, as the number of gauge sets grows only polynomially. A win-win.
  \item
A gauge set is by definition UV and IR finite. The worldline formalism
quenched QED needs wave function
counterterms, as in \refeq{IRstruct(1)}.
  \item
Things get interesting with reformulating the quenched 3-loop calculation
as four worldline integrals / gauge sets, see \reffig{Cvit77bFig3} and
\reftab{tabGaugeSets}. In particular, the fermion line attachments of
different kinds of $N$-photon propagators now get intertwined.
  \item
One electron-loop insertion into $(1,0,0)$  might be the easiest
worldline integral to
evaluate, but I find the quenched sets a higher priority.
  \item
One photon-photon scattering electron-loop insertion into $(2,0,0)$ might
be the most tempting to evaluate, but I find the quenched sets a higher
priority.
    \end{enumerate}
My main problem at the moment (well, there are many:) is that nobody
seems to have written an explicit formula for the spinor QED anomalous
magnetic moment in the worldline formalism.
