Dear Sergey

I have just read your
{\em New method of computing the contributions of graphs without lepton
loops to the electron anomalous magnetic moment in {QED}}\rf{Volkov17}
(and the earlier \refref{Volkov16}) with great interest, and I can see
that you are set to compute the 5-loop correction to the electron
$(g-2)$. This is a very hard calculation, and approaching it
strategically is a necessity.

May I suggests that you order your calculation by gauge-invariant sets,
as listed (for the 4-loop case) in Stefano Laporta's
\reftab{Laporta17:tableset} and illustrated in
\reffig{Laporta17figuragau}? My hunch is that the gauge set (6) would be
the most interesting, though Stefano thinks it too hard, and suggests
starting with a 5-loop relative of the set (3) instead. While the
contributions of individual graphs (and self-energy sets\rf{AoHaKiNi15})
are all over the place, the gauge-invariant sets are insanely small up to
order 8, and it would be very sweet to see that this continues through
order 10 (at least for the 5-loop graphs with no electron loops).

best regards
\\

Dear Stefano

thanks for the listings of gauge sets, and of course, for your whole amazing
project. While in detail my 1977 guesses are wrong, the overall finiteness conjecture
still looks good - it's crazy how small all these individual contributions are.
Has anybody (I do not follow that literature) come up with any ideas how to
bound the sizes of gauge sets?

The reason I got into a collaboration with Kinoshita (nominally, Tung-Mow Yan was
my adviser) is that he gave me 3-loop ladder diagram (at 4-loops, it would belong
to your gauge set (6)), and I derived a compact formula for the parametric
integrand of any number of loops ladder diagram. So maybe gauge sets of type (6)
are the easiest to evaluate?

Is evaluating gauge set (6) with 5 loops be feasible? If that turns out to be
+1/2, that would be sweet.

best regards
\\

\item[2017-05-05 Laporta]
To my knowledge, there are no ideas how to bound the sizes of the gauge sets.

In the set (6) the ladder is easy to evaluate, but the others are not.
The evaluation of the set (6) with five loops would be a real challenge.

Among the sets (1)-(6), the easiest to evaluate is the set (3).

\item[2013-11-23  Predrag] The surprise about Aoyama \etal\rf{AoHaKiNi12}
is that they have completely ignored my paper\rf{Cvit77b}, and for
them the set of all diagrams without a fermion loop (their `q-type',
presumably for `quenched-type') is one `gauge-invariant set'. So their sets
are the crudest possible, counting only different lepton loop insertions.
Their `q-type' set is the sum of my gauge-invariant sets. For example, for 4-loop
contributions I have 8 gauge-invariant sets (where time-reversed pairs count as
one set).

Their $A^{(6)}_1 = 1.18\dots $ includes the one electron
loop correction (so it is not `quenched'), while I wrote down in Fig.~3
that the sum is $\aql{6} = 0.93\dots $, not sure where the difference
comes from. It does not matter as far as my finiteness conjecture is
concerned.


\input{Laporta17figuragau}
%\Laporta17figuragau

\item[2017-04-28 Laporta] \rf{Laporta17}
has evaluated up to 1100 digits of precision the contribution of the 891
4-loop Feynman diagrams contributing to the electron $g-2$.

The vertex diagrams can be arranged in 25
gauge-invariant sets (\reffig{Laporta17figuragau}),
classifying them according to the number of photon corrections on the
same side of the main electron line and the insertions of electron loops (see
Cvitanovi\'c\rf{Cvit77b} for more details on the 3-loop classification).
The numerical contributions of each set, truncated to 40 digits, are
listed in the \reftab{Laporta17:tableset}.
Adding respectively the contributions of diagrams with and without
closed electron loops one finds

No closed electron loops:
\begin{align}
 \aql{8}&= -2.176866027739540077443259355895893938670 \,.
\end{align}
Aoyama \etal\rf{AoHaKiNi12} also find that $\aql{8}= -2.17\dots$
%Closed electron loops only:
%\begin{align}
% \aql{4}&=  \phantom{+}0.264620262813094503290612188456063884609 \,.
%\end{align}

My 1977\rf{Cvit77b} prediction $\aql{8} \approx  0$
(instead of the correct $\aql{8}= -2.18\ldots$) is for the no closed
electron loops sets (1) to (6). Not too far off for a sum of 518 vertex
diagrams.

{\em Tenth-order electron anomalous magnetic moment: {Contribution} of
diagrams without closed lepton loops}
summarize the results of their numerical work on the complete
determination of the 10th-order contribution to the anomalous magnetic
moment.

Their quenched set $V$ gives

$\aql{10} = 8.726(336)$,

$\aql{10} \approx 3/2 $, which is not too
far off for a sum of 6354 independent vertex diagrams (belonging to 389
self-energy diagrams).

\item[2017-05-19 Volkov]
{\em New method of computing the contributions of graphs without lepton
loops to the electron anomalous magnetic moment in {QED}}\rf{Volkov17}:

In \refref{Volkov16} Volkov explains that $A_1^{(2n)}$ is free from
infrared divergences since they are removed by the on-shell
renormalization as well as the ultraviolet ones.
However, Volkov also states that there is no universal
method in QED for canceling IR divergences in the
Feynman graphs analogous to the R operation, and
that the standard subtractive on-shell renormalization cannot remove
IR divergences point-by-point in Feynman-parametric space as well as it
does for UV divergences. Moreover, it can generate additional
IR-divergences.

    {\em
%    \PC{2017-05-20
    A tangent:
    That QED on-mass shell amplitudes are IR-free must be an old result;
    even I have several papers generalizing that to
    QCD\rf{MassShell,IRstruct,QCDmshell,NPB81}. I believe I solved (and
    Tom Kinoshita believes he solved it) the problem of point-by-point
    removal of IR divergences in Feynman-parametric space in my
    thesis\rf{CviKin74b}. I do not know about Tom, but I have a bright
    memory of figuring out how to do it one quiet evening in Ithaca,
    babysitting for a friend's toddler. But, as Volkov
    explains\rf{Volkov16}, our approach was apparently not general enough
    to deal with 4-loop and higher order corrections.
     }

Volkov's algorithm is based on the ideas used for proving UV-finiteness
of renormalized Feynman amplitudes\rf{Speer68,AnZaPo73}.
He studies $A_1^{(2n)}[\text{no lepton loops}]$, or, in Aoyama
\etal\rf{AoHaKiNi12} nomenclature, `q-type' or `quenched-type'
$\aql{2n}$ contributions of diagrams with no lepton loops.

Volkov  has evaluated the the ladder
%(Figure \ref{fig_ladder})
and the cross graphs
%(Figure \ref{fig_crosses})
up to 5 loops. The cross graphs do not contain divergent subgraphs, so
their contributions only depend on the gauge, but not on the choice of
subtraction procedure.
%The results for the ladder graphs and for the cross
%graphs are provided in Table \ref{table_ladder} and Table
%\ref{table_cross} respectively.

While Volkov organizes Feynman graphs by self-energy graph families, in
contrast to \refrefs{CviKin74c,CarYao74,Carroll75,AoHaKiNi15} he does
not evaluate these self-energy graphs directly
(for example, Kinoshita and Lindquist\rf{KinLin90} replace the 518
quenched vertex $\aql{8}$ diagrams by 47 self-energy diagrams);
all his calculations are performed with vertex graphs. Individual  vertex
graphs are precisely what is  necessary for evaluating gauge-invariant
sets\rf{Cvit77b}.


    {\em
%    \PC{2017-05-20
    A tangent:
    I believe computing $(g-2)$ directly from self-energy graphs is my
    contribution, from my thesis, see the ``new formula'' (6.22) in
    \refref{CviKin74c}, based on the Ward-Takahashi identity. Not only it
    uses fewer Feynman graphs, but it was very important for us, as it
    enabled us to calculate the electron magnetic moment by two wholly
    independent methods (and in this way we did actually identify and
    eliminate a subtle numerical error in one of the graphs). Tom
    Kinoshita probably believes that the idea come from him. I am not
    sure about that, my memory is unreliable; some of my recollections
    are
    \HREF{http://chaosbook.org/~predrag/papers/preprints.html\#PerturbativeQED}
    {here}.
%
Carroll papers\rf{CarYao74,Carroll75} puzzle me. He gives the credit to
the mass-operator formalism of
Schwinger\rf{Schwinger51a,Schwinger51b,Sommerfield58}, but no credit to
us\rf{CviKin74c}, even though his papers look closer to ours than to
Schwinger and Sommerfield - he also uses the Ward-Takahashi identity. Our
formulation might be equivalent to Schwingers, but it looks quite
different in detail, and I was not aware of Schwinger mass-operator when
I derived it.
