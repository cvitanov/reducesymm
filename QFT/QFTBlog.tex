\item[2024-02-13 Predrag]
Very impressed by

{David Tong}'s course materials /
\HREF{http://www.damtp.cam.ac.uk/user/tong/qft.html}
{online books}.
Also like the HTML layout (in this gitHub folder), might use something like that?

\item[2014-08-13 Predrag]
In my notes it says that Dyson himself told me to read {\em Drawing
theories apart: the dispersion of {Feynman} diagrams in postwar physics},
by Kaiser\rf{Kaiser09}. So we better read it - I will put a pilfered
eBook copy \HREF{http://ChaosBook.org/library/Kaiser09.pdf}{Kaiser09.pdf}
into ChaosBook.org/library.

\item[2024-02-18 Predrag] Now that I have read further into
Kevin Costello's textbook
\HREF{https://web.archive.org/web/20160304134950/http://math.northwestern.edu/~costello/renormalization_book.pdf}
{(click here)},
I have to acknowledge, sadly, that Kevin is not my brother by another
mother. The book does not work for our QFT course. The lectures 1 and 2
linked below I still recommend, but by lecture 3, Costello takes us in
direction that I should suffer in silence, without dragging you there. It's for
*gasp!* mathematicians.

The free early version of the book (click
\HREF{https://web.archive.org/web/20160304134950/http://math.northwestern.edu/~costello/renormalization_book.pdf}
{here}) has identical contents and numbers of pages, so I think it is
good enough.
I like following the
\HREF{https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/Renormalization+and+Effective+Field+Theory}
{nLab} branched tree exposition of his approach.

I might use his
sect.~2. \emph{Functional integrals in quantum field theory} as
the summary of the general field theory part of the course.

In my humble opinion, the original version is still the best:

{\em Quantum Field Theory II} is very good.

For example,  I watched

\videoLink{https://youtu.be/cbfmMz-kDjI?si=at3w7Vkg-OUC0G6_}
{\em Lecture 13 - Evaluation of non-Gaussian path integrals}
is a very clean discussion of the semiclassical approximation and nonlinear
corrections in the path-integral formulation of QM.

I'll alert you as I find lectures that fit into our course. Or you alert me.

\item[2017-03-15 Predrag] Read
Setlur\rf{Setlur13}
{\em Dynamics of Classical and Quantum Fields: An Introduction}.
Starts with
\\
Geometrical meaning of Legendre transformation in classical mechanics;
\\
Dynamical symmetries in the context of Noether's theorem;
\\
The derivation of the stress energy tensor of the electromagnetic field;
the expression for strain energy in elastic bodies, and the Navier Stokes
equation;
Functional integration is interpreted as a limit of a sequence of
ordinary integrations, ... .
The rest is less obvious.

In principle, this book can be read online via
\texttt{library.gatech.edu}, but how?

\item[2018-01-31 Predrag] Check out
M. J. D. Hamilton\rf{Hamilton17}
{\em Mathematical Gauge Theory}: ``
This book explains the mathematical background behind the Standard Model,
translating ideas from physics into a mathematical language and vice versa.
The first part of the book covers the mathematical theory of Lie groups and
Lie algebras, fibre bundles, connections, curvature and spinors. The second
part then gives a detailed exposition of how these concepts are applied in
physics, concerning topics such as the Lagrangians of gauge and matter
fields, spontaneous symmetry breaking, the Higgs boson and mass generation of
gauge bosons and fermions.
[...] Only a basic knowledge of differentiable manifolds and special
relativity is required, summarized in the appendix.

\begin{description}
%\item[2013-11-23  Predrag] Moved all matters QFT from
%\texttt{siminos/blog/Lie.txt} to here.

\item[2010-03-04 Predrag]
Kevin Mitchell is here, says we should study Littlejohn and
M. Reinsch\rf{LiRe97}: ``Gauge fields in the separation of
rotations and internal motions in the $n$-body problem.'' I
will put it into \wwwcb{/library}. Read 3-body problem
sections. See p. 14 for a discussion of the three-body
coordinates and p. 25 for a discussion of the three-body
section (gauge).



\item[2011-07-27 PC]
What follows is casting eye far ahead - to the role of gauge invariance
in Quantum Field Theories.
Following articles seem of interest as follow-ups on
Cvitanovi\'c\rf{PCar}, {\em Group theory for {Feynman} diagrams in
non-{Abelian} gauge theories}:

Khellat\rf{Khel10} strikes me as dubious...

Martens\rf{Mart11} writes: ``We calculate the two-loop matching corrections for the
   gauge couplings at the Grand Unification scale in a general framework
   that aims at making as few assumptions on the underlying Grand Unified
   Theory (GUT) as possible. In this paper we present an intermediate
   result that is general enough to be applied to the Georgi-Glashow
   SU(5) as a ``toy model''. The numerical effects in this theory are
   found to be larger than the current experimental uncertainty on $\alpha$s .
   Furthermore, we give many technical details regarding renormalization
   procedure, tadpole terms, gauge fixing and the treatment of group
   theory factors, which is useful preparative work for the extension of
   the calculation to supersymmetric GUTs.
   ''

Tye and Zhang\rf{TyZh10} write: ``
Bern, Carrasco and Johansson have conjectured dual
   identities inside the gluon tree scattering amplitudes.
   We use the properties of the heterotic string and open string tree
   scattering amplitudes to refine and derive these dual identities.
   These identities can be carried over to loop amplitudes using the
   unitarity method. Furthermore, given the $M$-gluon (as well as
   gluon-gluino) tree amplitudes, $M$-graviton (as well as
   graviton-gravitino) tree scattering amplitudes can be written down
   immediately, avoiding the derivation of Feynman rules and the
   evaluation of Feynman diagrams for graviton scattering amplitudes

Eto \etal\rf{EFGKNOV08} write:
   ``We construct the general vortex solution in the color-flavor-locked
   vacuum of a non-Abelian gauge theory, where the gauge group is taken
   to be the product of an arbitrary simple group and U(1). Use of the
   holomorphic invariants allows us to extend the moduli-matrix method
   and to determine the vortex moduli space in all cases. Our approach
   provides a new framework for studying solitons of non-Abelian
   varieties with various possible applications in physics.''

and there is much much more...; will continue some other time.

\item[2011-11-03 PC] Today is that time. I'm sitting in
\HREF{http://intractability.princeton.edu/blog/2011/05/workshop-counting-inference-and-optimization-on-graphs/}
     {Intractability Workshop:}
     \emph{Counting, Inference and Optimization on Graphs}
with a bunch of high-level computer nerds, and I almost afraid to say
what I'll say next (plumbers avoid physicists that say such things): In
constructing our atlas of inertial manifold of turbulent pipe flow, we
fix the $SO(2) \times O(2)$ phase separately on each local chart. The
freedom of doing that is called ``local gauge invariance'' (blame Hermann
Weyl for the ugly word) and in the limit of $\infty$ period cycles, cycle
points are dense and their local charts are infinitesimal, so this is
really local gauge invariance. In the world of computer science they use
this freedom profitably, to reduce the number of terms they use in their
computations. That suggests that there might be a (variational?)
principle that selects an optimal choice of (relative) template phases
(\ie, gauge transformations that connect a chart to the next chart).

Nerds call this 'reparametrization' - it supposedly speeds up calculations.
Have not really seen that in quantum field theory, with exception of light
cone gauges and their relatively recent applications by the Witten cult.

Literature: \refref{CheChe08,YeChe11} and stuff on
\HREF{http://www.hpl.hp.com/personal/Pascal_Vontobel/ciog2011/reading_list_web.html}{this
site} (if you can understand any of it).

Feel free to ignore this remark. It's future research.

\item[2012-05-16  Parameswaran Nair]  vpnair@optonline.net writes
on saddle solutions of Yang-Mills:

I attributed the conjecture to Hitchin; it was actually due to Atiyah and
Jones. ''The only finite action solutions of the YM equations are
instantons, either self-dual or antiself-dual.'' This was the conjecture
for which the refs provide counter examples.

\HREF{http://ChaosBook.org/library/Schiff91.pdf}{Here is} the paper by my
student Schiff\rf{Schiff91}, who writes:
``
Following a proposal of Burzlaff (Phys.Rev.D 24 (1981) 546), we find
solutions of the classical equations of motion of an abelian Higgs model
on hyperbolic space, and thereby obtain a series of non-self-dual
classical solutions of four-dimensional SU(3) gauge theory. The lowest
value of the action for these solutions is roughly 3.3 times the standard
instanton action.
''

``
In physics, despite the fact that the non-self-dual solutions correspond
to saddle points, and not minima, of the Yang-Mills functional, to do a
correct semiclassical approximation by a saddle-point evaluation of the
path integral, it is certainly necessary to include a contribution due to
nonself-dual solutions, and if it should be the case that there is a
non-self-dual solution with action lower than the instanton action (this
question is currently open, and of substantial importance), then such a
contribution would even dominate. Unfortunately, it is questionable
whether the semiclassical approximation can give a reliable picture of
quantized gauge theories; it has been argued that in four-dimensional
gauge theory small quantum fluctuations
around classical solutions cannot be responsible for
confinement, unlike in certain lower-dimensional
theories. But it may still be possible to extract some
physics from the semiclassical approach. A first step in
such a direction would be to obtain a good understanding
of the full set of non-self-dual solutions and their properties.
[...] We pursue an old idea, due to Burzlaft
[10], for obtaining a non-self-dual, ''cylindrically symmetric''
solution for gauge group SU(3). If we write
$\reals^4 = \reals \times \reals^3$, and identify some SU(2) [or SO(3)] subgroup
of SU(3), with generators that we will denote T', then we
can look at the set of SU(3) gauge potentials which are invariant
under the action of the group generated by the
sum of the T''s and the generators of rotations on the IR
factor of E (we choose the T''s and the IR rotation generators
to satisfy the same commutation relations). We
call such potentials ''cylindrically symmetric'' (in analogy
to the standard notion of cylindrical symmetry in IR,
which involves writing R =RXIR and requiring rotational
symmetry on the E factor). Such potentials will
be specified by a number of functions of two variables:
the coordinate on the IR factor of E (which we will
denote x), and the radial coordinate of the E factor
(which we will denote y). Clearly the equations of motion
for such cylindrically symmetric potentials (if they are
consistent) will reduce to equations on the space
I (x,y ):y ~ 0].
,,

The earlier work is by Sibner, Sibner, Uhlenbeck\rf{SiSiUhl89}. They
write ``
The Yang-Mills functional for connections on principle SU(2) bundles over
S 4 is studied. Critical points of the functional satisfy a system of
second-order partial differential equations, the Yang-Mills equations. If,
in particular, the critical point is a minimum, it satisfies a
first-order system, the self-dual or anti-self-dual equations. Here, we
exhibit an infinite number of finite-action non-minimal unstable critical
points. They are obtained by constructing a topologically nontrivial loop
of connections to which min-max theory is applied. The construction
exploits the fundamental relationship between certain invariant
instantons on S 4 and magnetic monopoles on H 3. This result settles a
question in gauge field theory that has been open for many years.
''

%@article{
%author = {Gil Bor and Richard Montgomery},

Bor\rf{Bor92} writes
``
We prove the existence of a new family of non-self-dual finite-energy
solutions to the Yang-Mills equations on Euclidean four-space, with SU(2)
as a gauge group. The approach is that of ``equivariant geometry:''
attention is restricted to a special class of fields, those that satisfy
a certain kind of rotational symmetry, for which it is proved that (1) a
solution to the Yang-Mills equations exists among them; and (2) no
solution to the self-duality equations exists among them. The first
assertion is proved by an application of the direct method of the
calculus of variations (existence and regularity of minimizers), and the
second assertion by studying the symmetry properties of the linearized
self-duality equations. The same technique yields a new family of
non-self-dual solutions on the complex projective plane.
''

\item[2012-04-19 Daniel] ``graveyard of obvious ideas'' rings a little
    aggressive, no? ``if you are a master of quantum-mechanics or QFT symmetries
and their linear irreducible representations,\rf{PCgr} you may leave your
baggage at the door'' rings a little aggressive, too.
\\{\bf Predrag:} Get's edgy. In ``master of their linear irreducible
    representations'' I make fun of myself. Let the referee object to
    that?


{\bf [2012-06-14 Predrag]} Grin and bear it. Pulling my Senior discount
card here.

\item[2013-04-16  Predrag] There seems to be whole literature on
classical Yang-Mills (CYM). In
{\em Entropy production in classical Yang-Mills theory from Glasma
initial conditions} Hideaki Iida,  Teiji Kunihiro,  Berndt M\"uller,
Akira Ohnishi,  Andreas Sch\"afer,  and Toru T. Takahashi,
\arXiv{1304.1807}, % \rf{IKMOST13}
write:

Pure Yang-Mills theory in temporal gauge with the Hamiltonian in the
noncompact (A, E) scheme on a cubic spatial lattice. The initial
condition satisfies Gauss' law; check its validity as well as Energy
conservation carefully at every time step. Define distance (6), (7) that
is gauge invariant under residual (time independent) gauge transformations.

                                                    \inCB
They call the stability matrix `Hessian', and its eigenvalues at time
slice the `local Lyapunov exponents (LLEs)'\rf{KMOSTY10}: LLE plays the
role of a ``temporally local'' Lyapunov exponent, which specifies the
departure rate of two trajectories in a short time period. Then they say
this (?): ``For a system where stable and unstable modes couple with each
other as in the present case, an LLE does not generally agree with the
Lyapunov exponent in a long time period.'' ``\refRef{KMOSTY10} introduced
another kind of Lyapunov exponent called the intermediate Lyapunov
exponent (ILE), which is an ``averaged Lyapunov exponent'' for an
intermediate time period; i.e., a time period which is sufficiently small
compared to the thermalization time but large enough to sample a
significant fraction of phase space. By its definition (13) it
is the set of stability exponents for a finite time \jacobianM.

``Two comments are in order, here: A Lyapunov exponent [PC: not the
Lyapunov exponent, they mean the stability exponent] can be (real)
positive, negative, zero or purely imaginary. Liouville's theorem tells
us that the determinant of the time evolution matrix U is unity, implying
that the sum of all positive and negative ILEs is zero. The KS entropy is
given as a sum of positive Lyapunov exponents. The second comment
concerns gauge invariance of the Lyapunov exponents. In the Appendix we
show that LLE and ILE are indeed gauge invariant under time-independent
gauge transformations in the temporal gauge.''

\item[2013-11-27  Predrag] One way to reduce symmetry seems obvious;
\textbf{average over the group orbit}. That reduces the dimension of the \statesp\
by the dimension of the group orbit; in the reduced \statesp\ each group
orbit is replaced by a point, it's average value. It is a natural construct
in the theory of linear
representations of groups, very important, where it is called a
`character' of the representation; I use it in my
\HREF{http://chaosbook.org/~predrag/papers/Cvi07.pdf} {trace formula} for
systems with continuous symmetries. But it is a trace of a linear evolution
operator.

Still, I do not seem to know how to do this for (1) nonlinear systems,
(2) QFT gauge fixing. Barth and Christensen\rf{BarChr83}  is an example
where this is done - perhaps a way too complicated example... (here are
my notes \HREF{http://chaosbook.org/FieldTheory/extras/BarChr83note.pdf}
{on it}, which I no longer understand myself :)

\item[2014-01-11 Predrag]
I always wonder whether we should be reducing symmetries
by averaging over group orbits (method of characters, used in
my derivation of the {\Fd} in presence of continuous symmetries).
Churchill, Kummer and Rod\rf{ChKuRo83} write in
{\em On averaging, reduction, and symmetry in {Hamiltonian} systems}:
The existence of periodic orbits for Hamiltonian systems at
low positive energies can be deduced from the existence of nondegenerate
critical points of an averaged Hamiltonian on an associated ``reduced
space.'' The paper exploits discrete symmetries, including reversing
diffeomorphisms, that occur in a given system. The symmetries are used to
locate the periodic orbits in the averaged Hamiltonian, and thence in the
original Hamiltonian when the periodic orbits are continued under
perturbations admitting the same symmetries.''

\item[2014-01-11 Predrag]
Kummer\rf{Kummer81}, {\em On the construction of the reduced phase space
of a {Hamiltonian} system with symmetry} writes:
``
Weinstein [...] uses this correspondence between connections
and lifts in his construction of Sternberg's phase space for a
particle in a Yang-Mills field.

Paul Hoyer recent talk at
\HREF{http://www.physics.ncsu.edu/LC2014/LC2014-Friday/PaulHoyer.pdf}
{Light Cone 2014} is too packed to be useful, but maybe has some pointers
to recent interesting non-perturbative QCD results.

\item[2014-08-01 Burak]
Sydney Coleman\rf{Col77} gave a lecture on semi-classical formulations of QFT in 1975.
He has several semi-classical treatment methods with names
``Zeroth-Order Weak-Coupling Expansion",
``Coherent-State Variation",
``First-Order Weak-Coupling Expansion",
``Bohr-Sommerfeld Quantization", and
``DHN Formula". I didn't yet understand what any of these means, I'm just starting
to read it, but if we can find a way of adapting these methods to the numerical
calculations that might be a good starting point.

\item[2014-08-01 Predrag]
Coleman was a great expositor - on a level of a Nobelist. Would be cute
if we found something in his lectures we can use today. ``DHN Formula" (I
knew all three - the first two authors are currently dead) should be the
Gutzwiller formula for QFT. Paolo Muratore-Ginanneschi, a former student
in our Copenhagen group, wrote something on that\rf{Murat03} that I still
have not studied in depth. But we maybe should.

\item[2014-08-01 Burak]
Coleman refers to the pedagogical overview by Rajaraman\rf{Raj75} for the derivation
of ``DHN Formula'' and I think this will be a good starting point for me. So far,
keywords are familiar, in the introduction, he talks about periodic orbits and
their stability and how hard it is to find them for realistic cases. A lot of work
apparently in this period has been done using Sine-Gordon equation because they
had analytical solutions. I looked for articles which cite \rf{Raj75} but didn't
see anything that relies on numerical solutions of field equations.

\item[2014-11-05 Predrag]
Do not know if this is something for us, but worth having a look at:

Luca Salasnich,
 \emph{Discrete bright solitons in Bose-Einstein condensates and dimensional
  reduction in quantum field theory}, \arXiv{1411.0160}:
`` We  review the derivation of an effective one-dimensional (1D) discrete
nonpolynomial Schr\"odinger equation from the continuous 3D Gross-Pitaevskii
equation with transverse harmonic confinement and axial periodic potential.
Then we study the bright solitons obtained from this discrete nonpolynomial
equation showing that they give rise to the collapse of the condensate above a
critical attractive strength. We also investigate the dimensional reduction of
a bosonic quantum field theory, deriving an effective 1D nonpolynomial
Heisenberg equation from the 3D Heisenberg equation of the continuous bosonic
field operator under the action of transverse harmonic confinement. Moreover,
by taking into account the presence of an axial periodic potential we find a
generalized Bose-Hubbard model which reduces to the familiar 1D Bose-Hubbard
Hamiltonian only if a strong inequality is satisfied. Remarkably, in the
absence of axial periodic potential our 1D nonpolynomial Heisenberg equation
gives the generalized Lieb-Liniger theory we obtained some years ago.''

\item[2014-11-23 Predrag]
Zvonkin\rf{Zvonkin97} \CBlibrary{Zvonkin97}
writes in
{\em Matrix integrals and map enumeration: {An} accessible introduction}:
``Physicists working in two-dimensional quantum gravity invented a new
method of map enumeration based on computation of Gaussian integrals over
the space of Hermitian matrices. This paper explains the basic facts of
the method and provides an accessible introduction to the subject.''

\item[2015-01-09 Predrag]

Tudor Dimofte gave a talk in Math on
{\em Geometric representation theory, symplectic duality, and 3d
supersymmetric gauge theory}

Abstract: Recently, a ``symplectic duality" between D-modules on certain
pairs of algebraic symplectic manifolds was discovered, generalizing
classic work of Beilinson-Ginzburg-Soergel in geometric representation
theory. I will discuss how such dual spaces (some known and some new) arise
naturally in supersymmetric gauge theory in three dimensions.

Tudor is a mathematical physicist at the IAS,
School of Physics, Princeton.

I went to the talk, and - wow! You would think I know something about a
gauge theory but is is like it was in Lithuanian: I understood individual
words, and the alphabet seemed to be Latin - there were things that
looked like letter G or letter H and what we call quotient M/G is
apparently called `resolution'. The foundational paper is Braden, Licata,
Proudfoot and Webster\rf{BrLiPrWe12}, and its followups on
``Quantizations of conical symplectic resolutions II: category O and
symplectic duality''. Good luck reading these...

and of course, it was emphatically N=4 and not N=2, so now I'm at peace

If you are referring to Feynman comments on your book, I definitely disagree
with them - I found your book on field theory more than helpful!

It is very difficult to study (quantum) turbulence within our approach -
however it would be very interesting to do so! The original idea was to
derive the two-fluid hydrodynamics of superfluids from an underlying
field theory. To be able to obtain analytical results, we had to apply
some rather drastic simplifications:

We assumed the superfluid condensate to be uniform and homogeneous (which
translate in a homogeneous superflow in the hydro picture). Further more
we used imaginary time formalism which strictly limits us to study
systems in equilibrium. It would most likely be very challenging (in
particular numerically) to introduce a condensate with arbitrary space
and time dependence. In the current calculations, a probable onset of
turbulence manifests itself as "something going wrong" - for example
above certain velocities of the superfluid it is no longer possible to
construct a stable and homogeneous superfluid phase. Another example is
the appearance of the ``two-stream instability" which can also be detected
in our approach (see for instance \arXiv{1312.5993}).
I am not sure yet how much this approach has in common with the one you
have cited.

``... wave equations that arise from geometric
considerations. Prime examples include the wave map equation and
the Yang-Mills equation on the Minkowski space. On one hand, these
are fundamental field theories arising in physics; on the other hand,
they may be thought of as the hyperbolic analogues of the harmonic map
and the elliptic Yang-Mills equations, which are interesting geometric
PDEs on their own. I will discuss the recent progress on the problem of
global regularity and asymptotic behavior of solutions to these PDEs.''
\end{quote}

This kind of work might offer a path to computing non-trivial ``exact
coherent states'' (non-perturbative classical solutions) of Yang-Mills.
Experimentally I used Evernote on my phone to take notes and photos of
the white board -
\HREF{160406SungJinOh.pdf} {160406SungJinOh.pdf} in this repository -
maybe it helps if one wants to get started reading the literature, though
it is going to be hard going.

Both in the Abelian case (what they call ``Maxwell-Klein-Gordon'' for a
scalar charged particle and ``Maxwell-Dirac'' for spin 1/2), and in the
non-Abelian case (what they call ``Yang-Mills'') they cheerfully set the
particle mass to $m=0$, which is a killer for us.

I tried to briefly explain to Sung-Jin Oh two things of possible interest
to people solving the classical Maxwell-Klein-Gordon and Yang-Mills PDEs:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item
\HREF{http://chaosbook.org/~predrag/papers/preprints.html\#FiniteFieldTheo}
{finiteness conjecture}: perhaps they can find saddle-points
(non-perturbative classical solutions of QED) that give the
gauge sets as the starting step in perturbative calculations,
rather than computing Feynman-diagrammatic corrections to trivial vacuum.

My explanation probably did more harm than good, as I liberally mixed in
QFT, and kept confusing the quantum and the classical problem - it is for
a reason that PDE people do not know what expressions like
``on-mass-shell amplitudes" and ``Ward identities" mean.

  \item
I ran Sung-Jin Oh quickly through \HREF{http://chaosbook.org/tutorials/}
{ChaosBook.org/tutorials} to make him aware that for turbulent nonlinear
PDEs one has to work in the $\infty$\dmn\ \statesp, rather than look at
the solutions only in the $(d+1)$\dmn\ configuration space.

He would have been more impressed if we could find such solutions for
Eulerian flows, and give him a criterion which solutions are important,
but I have no idea how to find smooth solutions for Euler (no viscosity
Laplacian to help us there...).

\end{enumerate}

All in all, I still have no idea for what kind of `exact coherent states'
to compute for Yang-Mills.

finite parts), perhaps they are not so different. Let's think of gauge
symmetry as we think of other continuous symmetries in theory of
dynamical systems. Then quotienting the symmetry leads us to gauge sets,
which have no symmetry, but each has $n!$ Feynman diagram contributions -
a ``$\phi^4$'' for each gauge set. Erik tells me that someone has proven

$a^{HVP\,LO}_\mu=715.4(18.7) \times 10^{-10}$. By supplementing lattice
data for very short and long distances with R-ratio data, we
significantly improve the precision to $a^{HVP\,LO}_\mu=692.5(2.7) \times
10^{-10}$. This is the currently most precise determination of
$a^{HVP\,LO}_\mu$.

Borsanyi \etal\rf{Borsanyi18} {\em Hadronic vacuum polarization
contribution to the anomalous magnetic moments of leptons from first
principles}:
compute the leading, strong-interaction contribution to the anomalous
magnetic moment of the electron, muon, and tau using lattice quantum
chromodynamics (QCD) simulations. Calculations include the effects of u,
d, s, and c quarks and are performed directly at the physical values of
the quark masses and in volumes of linear extent larger than 6 fm. All
connected and disconnected Wick contractions are calculated. They obtain
$a^{LO-HVP}_e=189.3(2.6)(5.6) \times 10^{-14}$,
$a^{LO-HVP}_\mu=711.1(7.5)(17.4) \times 10^{-10}$, and
$a^{LO-HVP}_\tau=(0.8)(3.2 \times 10^{-8}$,
where the first error is statistical and the second is systematic.

``Today, $a_e$ is one of the most precisely measured\rf{HaFoGa08} and
computed\rf{AoHaKiNi12a,AoHaKiNi15,AoKiNi18,AoKiN19} quantities in
nature, with a total uncertainty below 1 ppb. Theory and experiment agree
and the measurement can be used to make the most precise
determination\rf{AoHaKiNi15} of the fine-structure constant $\alpha$''.

\item[2018-06-17 Colin Parker]
The best measurement of $\alpha$ that I know is Parker \etal\rf{PYZEM18}
{\em Measurement of the fine-structure constant as a test of the
{Standard Model}}.
% \HREF{https://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.aap7706} {doi 10.1126/science.aap7706}.
It also provides a good list of the other
methods. Atoms, and not fancy emergent condensed matter phenomena, are
actually the most certain measurements. Besides QHE and $g-2$, there are
two atomic methods. One of the atomic methods is fine structure
spectroscopy of helium, which is competitive with QHE. This measures a
spin-orbit interaction, which is compared with detailed atomic physics
calculations, so in that sense it is similar to $g-2$, except it's not as
mny Feynman diagrams and more standard perturbation theory for atoms
(which is not to say that it necessarily converges either, I don't know).
The other method is to come directly from the Rydberg constant and the
electron rest mass, via the electron to cesium mass ratio, and an absolute
measurement of the cesium atomic mass using momentum transfer with
photons. That's what's reported in the linked paper and it's the best
that I know of: 0.20 ppb. It's in a 2.5 sigma tension with $g-2$ for what
it's worth, but not in a way that makes the muon $g-2$ measurements make a
ton of sense either.

\item[2018-06-17 Colin]
I guess it's not totally surprising to see a bunch of terms cancel, the
alternating harmonic series
\beq
\sum_{n = 1}^\infty \frac{(-1)^{n + 1}}{n}
= 1 - \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{3} - \frac{1}{4} + \frac{1}{5} - \cdots
\ee{CPaltHarmSer}
(or any conditionally convergent series) will have a large difference
between the absolute sum and the signed sum if you take a lot of terms.

\item[2018-06-18 Predrag] Can you cook up an example more dramatic than
\refeq{CPaltHarmSer}? The corresponding $g-2$ series has only the first 5
terms computed so far, with the sum of magnitudes of contributions to the
5th term some $10^5$ times larger than the result itself (in contrast to
the term 1/5 in \refeq{CPaltHarmSer}). Not only are these huge
cancelations, but they are occurring separately within each gauge set.

I only \emph{conjecture} that the $g-2=a(\alpha/\pi)$ is a convergent
series in $\alpha/\pi$. As long as I cannot prove, my convergence claim
is a speculation, not mathematics.

for trace potential

\,.
\ee{CHPS18(1.1)}
Their ``non-perturbative
ambiguity'' in the case of the $N = 1$ cubic matrix model seem to
amount to the Stokes phenomenon, \ie, choice of integration contour for
the Airy function.

Unlike the weak coupling expansions, the strong coupling expansion of
\beq
Z = \frac{1}{2\pi}\int dx e^{-\frac{1}{2g^2}x^2-x^4}

There is a negative dimensions type duality $N\to-N$, their eq.~(3.27).

Currently our favorite $\phi^4$ is any dimension, in practice in 1 and 2

in the current draft of our `deterministic field theory' paper
we work at Klein-Gordon mass-square values where perturbation theory makes
no sense ($\phi^4$ dominates over $\phi^2$). Here the solutions of
Euler-Lagrange equations (classical periodic and relative periodic
orbits) form a fractal set. Do not know what that means - any suggestion? - but it is
convenient for us, as the symbolic dynamics is complete - every symbol
sequence.

\item[2023-10-21 Predrag]
\newcommand{\pcell}{primitive cell}\newcommand{\Pcell}{Primitive cell}

Consider a \textbf{honeycomb lattice} of \reffig{fig:Kitaev06_honeycomb}\,(a).
Under the translation group, its {\pcell} can be taken as a hexagon tile
(lattice plaquette),

\includegraphics{Kitaev06invariant}
\,,

with dangling links labeled as in \reffig{fig:Kitaev06_honeycomb}\,(b).

If you take as primitive vectors the two unit lattice translations along
$60^o$ and $120^o$ directions, then their sum translate the lattice
by one tile vertically, and their difference generates
one-tile horizontal translation.

That might not be in your taste, as these primitive vectors are
orthogonal to  {\pcell} links.
So view the lattice as consisting of two equivalent simple sublattices,
``even'' and ``odd'' (empty, full circles in the figure).

Shifts along ``$x$-links'', ``$y$-links'', and ``$z$-links'' directions,
\reffig{fig:Kitaev06_honeycomb}\,(b), independent translations
along $x$ and $y$ directions, $z$ translation given by the sum
-$x$-link - $y$-translation, translate the 2 triangular sublattices
into each other. The lattice is invariant under pairs of
successive different shifts. For example, successive shifts, first along
$x$-links'', than along ``$y$-links translate the lattice by one lattice unit in the $z$ direction

The point group of either sublattice is $\Dn{3}$, 3 rotations, and 3
reflections. A sensible theory should also be invariant under
interchanging the two sublattices. Under all these discrete symmetries,
the honeycomb is built from Kitaev's `unit cell' that contains one vertex
of each kind.

The Hamiltonian
\begin{equation} \label{Kitaev06:Hamiltonian}
H\,=\,
-J_{x} \sum_{\text{$x$-links}} \sigma_{j}^{x}\sigma_{k}^{x}
-J_{y} \sum_{\text{$y$-links}} \sigma_{j}^{y}\sigma_{k}^{y}
-J_{z} \sum_{\text{$z$-links}} \sigma_{j}^{z}\sigma_{k}^{z},
\end{equation}
where $J_{x}$, $J_{y}$, $J_{z}$ are parameters, is a sparse,
almost diagonal (almost = the nearest neighbors) operator (an infinite
matrix acting on the infinite honeycomb lattice) of a block diagonal
form: it acts on lattice site 2-component 1/2-spin field with a 2\dmn\
local matrix (Pauli matrices, the identity). Were $J_{x}=J_{y}=J_{z}$,
one could write it as a Laplacian (see
\HREF{https://chaosbook.org/overheads/spatiotemporal/CL18.pdf\#equation.2.49}
{CL18 eq.~(2.49)}), with zero Klein-Gordon mass `potential'.
Bader, can you do this exercise? I do not remember doing it.

The individual operators in the Hamiltonian:
\begin{equation} \label{terms}
K_{jk}= \left\{
\begin{array}{l@{\quad}l}
\sigma_{j}^{x}\sigma_{k}^{x}, & \text{if $(j,k)$ is an $x$-link;} \\
\sigma_{j}^{x}\sigma_{k}^{y}, & \text{if $(j,k)$ is an $y$-link;} \\
\sigma_{j}^{x}\sigma_{k}^{z}, & \text{if $(j,k)$ is an $z$-link.}
\end{array}
\right.
\end{equation}
Remarkably, \emph{all} operators $K_{jk}$
commute with lattice plaquette (i.e., hexagon) operators
$W_{p}$:
\begin{equation} \label{Kitaev06:invariant}
\begin{array}{c} \includegraphics{Kitaev06invariant} \end{array} %\qquad\quad
W_{p}=\sigma_{1}^{x}\sigma_{2}^{y}\sigma_{3}^{z}
\sigma_{4}^{x}\sigma_{5}^{y}\sigma_{6}^{z}
=K_{12}K_{23}K_{34}K_{45}K_{56}K_{61}.
\end{equation}
It's probably not remarkable. As explained above, any non-repeating pair
of shifts along $x$-, $y$-, $z$-links is a unit lattice translation. The
three consecutive such in the chain \refeq{Kitaev06:invariant} add up to
a zero translation, so anything will commmute with it, including
operators $K_{jk}$, and different operators $W_{p'}$.

\item[2023-10-17 Predrag] On \textbf{group theory}:

Kitaev06 \HREF{https://arxiv.org/pdf/cond-mat/0506438.pdf\#equation.3.20}
{eq.~(20)} follows from the definition of a tensor,
\HREF{https://birdtracks.eu/version9.0/GroupTheory.pdf\#equation.3.2.26}
{birdtracks.eu eq.~(3.26)}:
a finite `rotation' of an
$n$-legged tensor rotates each leg (a `leg' is a free, not contracted index).

$e^{-iT\cdot\theta} M e^{iT\cdot\theta}$
is just how a Hermitian matrix $M$ (2-index tensor, one index up, one
down) transforms, Heisenberg version of the Schr{\"o}dinger equation
being a special case. As time evolution is a 1\dmn\,
abelian group, you don't even see an adjoint index.
Basically, Heisenberg is a statement of finite time
evolution,  Schr{\"o}dinger is the infinitesimal time step $=$
differential equation version.

I find the infinitesimal statement of tensor invariance,
\HREF{https://birdtracks.eu/version9.0/GroupTheory.pdf\#equation.4.4.36}
{birdtracks.eu eq.~(4.36)} and
{(4.33)},
easier to grasp.

If $M$ is built from $N$ generators in the $N$\dmn\ adjoint representations
2 indices shared with $M$, but the 3rd index in the adjoint rep (like 3
Pauli matrices, the generators of su(2)),  then various commutators give
structure constants $c_{ijk}$. They are generators of adjoint
representation rotations, hence the rotation matrix on the right hand
side of Kitaev06 {eq.~(20)}.

Examples:\\
\HREF{https://birdtracks.eu/course3/notes.pdf\#equation.10.5.10}
{eq.~(10.10)},
\HREF{https://birdtracks.eu/course3/notes.pdf\#equation.11.2.4}
{eq.~(11.4)} and thereabouts,
\HREF{https://birdtracks.eu/course3/notes.pdf\#equation.12.3.7}
{eq.~(12.7)}  and thereabouts,
but much of it is special to so(4) being a semisimple su(2)$\times$su(2),
misleading about the general case. My notes are \emph{not} a textbook
on group theory, only pointers to the literature. To learn it my way, you
need to go through videos listed at the beginning of each chapter, read
the literature if suggested.

\item[2023-10-21 Predrag]

I do spin representations in
\HREF{https://birdtracks.eu/version9.0/GroupTheory.pdf\#section.11.1}

{birdtracks.eu sect.~14.1}, my hat off to you:)
My birdtracks are good if you have to do real calculations (like
perturbative corrections). On a superficial level, standard literature is
good enough.

\item[2023-10-21 Predrag] On {\bf perturbation expansions}:

Currently my favorite bosonic field theory is scalar $\phi^4$ any
dimension, in practice in 1 and 2 dimensions.

We work at Klein-Gordon mass-square values where perturbation theory
in powers of the coupling strength of the nonlinear potential makes
no sense.  Our
potential term $\phi^4$ dominates over the `kinetic', Laplacian term.
This is known as the
anti-integrable limit
\HREF{https://chaosbook.org/overheads/spatiotemporal/CL18.pdf\#equation.3.73}
{CL18 eq.~(73)}
in the current draft of our `deterministic field theory' paper.

Kitaev06 Hamiltonian \refeq{Kitaev06:Hamiltonian} only has a `kinetic',
Laplacian term. It has no on-site potential
or spinor mass - it's a massless theory.

So Kitaev06, in
\HREF{https://arxiv.org/pdf/cond-mat/0506438.pdf\#subsection.5.10}
{5.1 {\em Perturbation theory study} }, breaks
the honeycomb \Dn{6} symmetry by singling out the vertical
$z$-links in
\reffig{fig:Kitaev06_honeycomb}\,(b),
and combines the $x$- and $y$-links into generators of horizontal
translations, his `potential' V, resulting in a $\Dn{2}\times\Dn{2}$
`non-relativisitc'
rectangular latice; lattice `constants'
or `coupling strengths' or `speed of light'
are different in the horizontal and vertical directions:

Kitaev06 Hamiltonian is $H=H_{0}+V$, where $H_{0}$ is the main part and $V$ is the
perturbation:
\[
H_{0} = -J_{z} \sum_{\text{$z$-links}} \sigma_{j}^{z}\sigma_{k}^{z},
\qquad\quad
V = -J_{x} \sum_{\text{$x$-links}} \sigma_{j}^{x}\sigma_{k}^{x}
-J_{y} \sum_{\text{$y$-links}} \sigma_{j}^{y}\sigma_{k}^{y}
\]
The important thing is that $H_0$ generates vertical translations, $V$
horizontal translation, so they commute. The propagator can be expanded
as a geometrical series in terms of the small parameter $J_{x}=J_{y}$,
\beq
\frac{1}{H_{0} + V} =
\frac{1}{H_{0}} \sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\left({H_{0}^{-1}{V}}\right)^n
\,,
\ee{Kitaev06:PertSeries}
and computes the first four terms. It's a calculation, as there are
various powers of Pauli matrices in various terms.  Odd terms vanish,
because you need even powers of $V$ to get to lattice translations.

As $\Dn{2}\times\Dn{2}$ includes symmetries under reflections across $x$
and $z$ axes, I believe that one could have written the theory in a Dirac
propagator form, linear in 'momentum', from the start, but working that
out might merit a stand-alone publication.

Kitaev06 first sets to the anti-integrable limit $J_{z}\to\infty$,
or $J_{x}=J_{y}=0$.
In that case this is a 1\dmn\ latice,
with  $\Dn{2}$ symmetry. Its ground state is highly
degenerate: each two spins connected by a $z$-link are aligned
( spinup spinup  or  spindown spindown), but their common direction is
not fixed.
% We regard each such pair as an effective spin.
% The transition from physical spins to effective spins is shown in
% Fig.~\ref{fig_perturb}a,b.
The ground state energy is $E_{0}=-NJ_{z}$,
where $N$ is the number of unit cells, i.e., half the number of spins.

I stop here - do not know whether this is helpful to Bader,
until he finds it helpful.

Come back when you get to the next hurdle.

Motivating and deriving statistical and quantum mechanics in the
disretized spacetime setting might appeal to a condensed or soft-matter
physicist, but it's not for everyone: atomic, optical, nuclear or general
relativity folk think of spacetime only as continuum, and of derivatives
only in the Leibniz calculus lattice spacing $h\to0$ limit. So maybe
Costello lectures would be more in your taste.

\HREF{https://perimeterinstitute.ca/people/kevin-costello}
{Kevin Costello}, Krembil William Rowan Hamilton Chair,
 strikes me a bit like a doppelganger of my
younger self (minus the Chair).

\videoLink{pirsa.org/18090054} {\em Lecture 1}

of his 2018
\HREF{https://pirsa.org/c18031}
{\em Renormalization and Effective Field Theory} course
is in the style of my \wwwQFT{pdf.html}, but I like my book better.

In our `kinetic' vs `potential' perspective, he starts out in the limit
were the pure Laplacian dominates  - fields very so fast as to overpower
the potential, parametrized by $\mu^2$, including the 2-point mass
$\phi^2$ term, her treated as a small, perturbative correction.

When Costello says "propagator", he only takes the inverse of the
Laplacian, not a massive boson propagator with $\mu^2>0$ that is my
preference. I see why - the inverse of the Laplacian in $d$ dimension is
simple
\beq
P(y,y') = \frac{1}{|y-y'|^{d-2}}
\ee{Costello18lec1}
with $d=2$ case equal $\ln|y-y'|$ (shouldn't the exponent be $(d-2)/2$)?
So not the massive Boson propagator which is a Bessel function.

As his focus will be effective field theory where high-energy
"ultraviolet" divergences due to the singularity of an inverse Laplacian
are renormalized away, separating this as the `kinetic' term is right.
In our semi-classical, deterministic field theory we are in the opposite,
"anti-integrable' limit, where the $\mu^2$ parameter potential dominates.

He does, however,  introduce the massive propagator in

\videoLink{pirsa.org/18090055}  {\em Lecture 2}

by the heat kernel method (\ie, the continuum version of my random
walks ending in death), so our approaches are very similar.

What we call Euclidean space he refers to as the `Riemannian signature',
as opposed to the physical, Lorentzian signature.

The things go off the rails starting with Lecture 3. In Lecture 5,
(massless!?) scalar $\phi^4$ over $\reals^4$ enters - he'll presumably
prove it exists. I'm out of here.


\bigskip

I feel he might be a kindred soul because he starts his
Costello\rf{Costello11} {\em Renormalization and Effective Field Theory}
(2011) monograph as this:


Most axiomatic formulations of quantum field theory in the literature
start from the Hamiltonian formulation of field theory. [...]
I believe that the Lagrangian formulation of quantum field theory, using
Feynman’s sum over histories, is more fundamental. The axiomatic framework
developed in this book is based on the Lagrangian formalism, and on
the ideas of low-energy effective field theory developed by Kadanoff (Kad66),
Wilson (Wil71), Polchinski (Pol84) and others.
[...]
The only assumptions I am making about the nature of quantum field theory
are the following:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item
The action principle: physics at every energy scale is described by a
Lagrangian, according to Feynman’s sum-over-histories philosophy.
  \item
Locality: in the limit as energy scales go to infinity, interactions
between fields occur at points.
\end{enumerate}
[...] The coefficients of the action of this local renormalization group
flow on any particular theory are the functions of that theory. I include
explicit calculations of the function of some simple theories, including
the $\phi^4$ theory on $\reals^4$.
[...]
I then classify all possible renormalizable scalar field theories,
and find the expected answer. For example, the only renormalizable scalar
field theory in four dimensions, invariant under isometries and under the
transformation $\phi^4\to-\phi^4$, is the $\phi^4$ theory.
[...]
Thus, in the approach to quantum field theory presented here, to
prove renormalizability of a particular theory, one simply has to
calculate the appropriate cohomology groups. No manipulation of Feynman
graphs is required.

I should emphasize that time evolution does not play a role in this picture:
quantum field theory on d-dimensional space-time is related to statistical
field theory on d-dimensional space. We must assume, however, that
the statistical system is in equilibrium.
[...]
The only difference between this picture and the quantum field theory formulation
is that we have replaced $\hbar$ by $T$.

If we consider the limiting case, when the temperature $T$ in our statistical
system is zero, then the system is ``frozen'' in some extremum of the
action functional $S( )$. In the dictionary between quantum field theory and
statistical mechanics, the zero temperature limit corresponds to classical
field theory. In classical field theory, the system is frozen at a solution to
the classical equations of motion.
Throughout this book, I will work perturbatively. In the vocabulary
of statistical field theory, this means that we will take the temperature
parameter $T$ to be infinitesimally small, and treat everything as a formal
power series in $T$. Since $T$ is very small, the system will be given by a small
excitation of an extremum of the action functional.
In the language of quantum field theory, working perturbatively means
we treat $\hbar$ as a formal parameter. This means we are considering small
quantum fluctuations of a given solution to the classical equations of motions.

[...]
There are many ways to define ``low energy''. I will start by giving a
definition which is conceptually very simple, but difficult to work with. In
this definition, the low energy fields are those functions on our manifold M
which are sums of low-energy eigenvectors of the Laplacian.
[...]
I will use a definition of effective field theory
based on length rather than energy. The great advantage of this definition
is that it relates better to the concept of locality.

(\textbf{2024-02-14 Predrag} at this time, I do not understand his
\emph{renormalization group equation} on p.~7).

{\em Analytic and numerical approaches for depictive 3-loop integrals
using sector decomposition}, (2024).

The sector decomposition (SD) method\rf{Heinrich08},   %[1–6]
\arXiv{0803.417},
is well-established for calculating loop integrals.
In this paper, we use a simple form of the SD method.
[...]
From the basic formula derived by this method, it is possible to obtain a specific
expression of the coefficients that represent the ultraviolet (UV) divergence analytically.
[...]
We deal with the UV singularity by dimensional regularization.

The paper is based on the Nakanishi–Cvitanovi{\'c}–Kinoshita
formalism\rf{Nakanishi57,CviKin74a,CviKin74b}.
After many clever parametric integral variable transformations they
split the integrals in Laurent series in $1/\epsilon$, and arrive at


"Equation (18) is our basic formula to calculate
the loop integral analytically and numerically."

with analytical formulas for prefactors as functions of $m^2$,  $\ln m^2$,
and nasty polylogs.
They encounter thresholds at $s=4\,m^2$, \etc., $s=$(external momentum squared)
that I am not familiar with.
Their results are in good agreement with Laporta\rf{Laporta2000}.

[...]
deep gratitude to Dr. T. Kaneko for showing us how to handle the SD method.

{\em Evaluation of three-loop self-energy master integrals with four or five propagators}
(2023) is probably not useful to whatever is it that I'm seaarching for.

I obtain identities satisfied by the three-loop self-energy master
integrals with four or five propagators with generic masses, including
the derivatives with respect to each of the squared masses and the
external momentum invariant. These identities are then recast in terms of
the corresponding renormalized master integrals, enabling
numerical evaluation of them by the differential equations approach.

By applying IBP relations repeatedly, %[11–28],
one can discover identities between different loop integrals with
common topological features, allowing one to eliminate
many of them in favor of a finite\rf{SmiPet10} number of master
integrals.

[...]
the differential equations satisfied by the three-loop self-
energy master integrals with four and five propagators are here
found explicitly, enabling their numerical computation.
