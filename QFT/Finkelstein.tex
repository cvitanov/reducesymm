David Ritz Finkelstein (July 19, 1929 -- January 24, 2016)

Finkelstein\rf{Finkel55}
{\em Internal structure of spinning particles}

MAY 15, 1958:
Finkelstein\rf{Finkel58}
{\em Past-future asymmetry of the gravitational field of a point particle}

\item[1990-05-24 David Finkelstein] \texttt{900524PhysToday.pdf}, a
letter to Physics Today (unpublished) in response to Khurana\rf{Khurana89a}.

Wilczek\rf{Wilczek82} {\em Quantum mechanics of fractional-spin
particles} names `anyons' (since interchange of two of these particles
can give any phase), credits  Leinaas and Myrheim (1977) etc., but not
Finkelstein.

Wilczek and Zee\rf{WilZee83}
{\em Linking numbers, spin, and statistics of solitons}:
``Some aspects of this subject appear to have been anticipated in the
remarkable paper of D. Finkelstein and J. Rubinstein\rf{FinRub68}."

Misner, Thorne and Zurek\rf{MiThZu09}
{\em {John Wheeler}, relativity, and quantum information}:
``The physics becomes lucid in 1959-62, through insights by David
Finkelstein"
`` which dealt with only half of the Schwartzfield geometry and revealed
its horizon and thence its role as a black hole"

Finkelstein\rf{Finkel87} {\em The Quantum Paradox},
in {Encyclopaedia Britannica} {Yearbook of Science and the Future}
is a very helpful popularization of his view of quantum mechanics.

Finkelstein \etal\rf{FJSS62}
{\em Foundations of quaternion quantum mechanics}

Adler\rf{Adler95} seems to credit them at length. In his 1996 review of
Adler's book, Finkelstein writes diplomatically\rf{Finkel96}: ``Adler
does cite a gauge-invariant quaternionic theory.Its imaginary operator
I varies in spacetime and is then a natural Higgs field. But this
theory does not account for color SU(3), the one-handed neutrino and
several other peculiarities of nature that seem to belong together.
Adler quite reasonably shelves this theory. Indeed, the gaps in this
theory led me to shelve the whole quaternionic project in the 1960s.
Adler suggests a quaternionic route that might close these gaps.''

\item[2016-02-21 Predrag]
A man wrote a whole PhD thesis\rf{Familton15}
    on {\em Quaternions: A History of Complex Noncommutative Rotation
    Groups in Theoretical Physics}, without mentioning  Finkelstein
    \etal\rf{FJSS62,FJS63,FJSS63} once. How is that possible? But the
    thesis looks iffy to me (PhD in Mathematics Education), so we'll
    let that one pass.

Hestenes\rf{Hestenes66} {\em Space-time Algebra}, not Jauch or
Finkelstein\rf{FJSS62,FJS63,FJSS63}, is apparently credited with the
invention of quaternionic quantum mechanics. They published first, but
there are no mutual citations - it's only much later Finkelstein cites
Hestenes, but no citations in the reverse direction.

Weird thing is that I have never heard of Professor Hestenes until
today, when I checked him out to find why he does not credit
Finkelstein \etal\rf{FJSS62,FJS63,FJSS63} for their quaternion quantum
mechanics. Neither does De Leo\rf{DeLeo96}-- but Finkelstein had cited
him in more recent papers.

Now, when I think of it, I think we do have a grad student who insists
computing everything in terms of bi-vectors, driving Zangwill to
distraction. Hestenes, of course, has yet another interpretation of
Quantum Mechanics\rf{Hestenes86}.

The idea of Euclidean / Minkowski spaces as limits of compact groups is
- actually - something Finkelstein strongly felt was the right thing to
do.

\section{Bellissard notes}
\label{sect:Bellissard}

Jean notes, 1 May 2016

About Predrag's remark concerning the proposal of Finkelstein to define a
new logic, I may have a clue. Just a clue.

I am not sure that Finkelstein was correct, but that is how I understand
the claim. I just spent three weeks teaching the Section of the book of
Cover and Thomas on {\em Information Theory}, concerning the Kolmogorov
Complexity. I used the notes I prepared for the Fall semester, based on
the book by Feynman of the Theory of Computation, to also describe in
detail the concept and the functioning of Turing Machines, the
non-solvability of the halting problem. What I did not understand in the
Fall and I understood very clearly this time is that there is a compete
equivalence between the point of view of Turing, namely designing a
machine (how inefficient it can be) to execute the usual task of
computing, and the point of view of G\"odel, namely establishing the
rules of logic. A Turing Machine is nothing but executing all possible
rules of logic, not more but not less. As a consequence, the halting
problem and the incompleteness theorems of G\"odel are exactly the same
claim, the first one expressed in the language of machines, appealing to
engineers, the other one expressed in the language of logic, appealing to
(arrogant) mathematicians.


    Then comes a problem: Quantum Mechanics is expressible in terms of the
    mathematical of "Set Theory", and obey all rules of logic, as established
    over the centuries by logician since Aristotle. At this point, the formalism
    can be complicated, using Hilbert spaces and operator algebras, using the
    quantum operations to describe the measurement or the dissipative phenomena,
    but all these mathematical tools are just a consequence of the axioms of Set
    Theory.


    So, if Turing is equivalent to G\"odel, any quantum machine performing quantum
    computation should be implementable on a Turing Machine (!!), including the
    key aspect of quantum computers namely the "entanglement". The entanglement
    is indeed, in principle, the main and only advantage of quantum computers
    over classical ones. It provides a way to make massive parallel computation,
    in particular this is exactly why the Quantum Fourier Transform (QFT) is
    much faster than the FFT: while the later requires $O(N \ln N)$ operations to
    compute the Fourier transform of a function on the integers modulo(N), the
    QFT requires only $O(\ln^2(N))$ operations !! One of the most striking
    consequences is that factorizing a very large integer of of order N requires
    $O(\ln^3(N))$ operations only while the best algorithm known so far on
    classical machines requires $O(\exp{ \ln^3(N)})$ (may be I am wrong on this last
    estimate).


    If a quantum computer is implementable on a Turing machine, then we should
    expect dramatic consequences. One of them could be that apart from improving
    the speed of the calculation, there are problems impossible to solve on a
    quantum computer as well, and that the class of such problems might not be
    much larger than the unsolvable ones on a classical computer.


    Similar concerns have been expressed recently Gil Kalai\rf{Kalai06}
    (Mathematics Department, Hebrew University of Jerusalem) in {\em The
    quantum computer puzzle}. The argument being that quantum systems are
    fundamentally "noisy", a statement that has been expressed many times
    by physicists in a different way: they talk of the fundamentally
    probabilistic character of Quantum Mechanics.


    In other words, discretizing quantum information in terms of the concept of
    "qbits" or "qubits", is fine, but controlling these units of quantum
    information might appear problematic, especially when it comes to
    engineer logical quantum gates. When I started teaching Quantum Computing in
    2003, I was expecting this problem to be solved soon. But in 2016, no
    qualitative progress big enough has been made in the technology
    to manipulate more than 12-15 qubits, which was what people knew to do 15
    years ago already. It may appear more and more in the near future that this
    task is hopeless.


    This is where the proposal of David Finkelstein may come about: by
    expressing the rules of logic through Boolean Algebra, Shannon, in his PhD
    Thesis, made the breakthrough that was required to implements the idea of
    Turing and G\"odel. So, I suspect Finkelstein to have though that something
    equivalent should be done to express or to encode quantum information.  He
    is even more radical, since he would like to propose enlarging the rules of
    logic to include the concepts that should be at the basis of Quantum
    Mechanics.


    May be he was dreaming, may be he was right, who knows ? But there are
    several facts that are hardly accepted by physicists, in particular the ones
    claiming the existence of a "Theory of Everything". Namely the Kolmogorov
    approach t complexity implies in particular that a very limited amount of
    data produced by Nature will ever be accessible to science. These data must
    have a finite Kolmogorov complexity, namely they can be reproduced by a
    finite algorithm, expressed by a finite string of 0's and 1's. Chaitin
    showed that, using the Halting Problem, or the G\"odel Incompleteness Theorem,
    it becomes easy to build numbers (the famous number Î©) that can be defined
    logically without ambiguity, but cannot be computed (if one except a small
    number of digits). He showed that the family of computable numbers is
    countable: hence this set is tiny. The same statement, expressed in terms of
    logic, means that among all logical claims that can be expressed through an
    infinite sequence of 0's and 1's, only a tiny proportion can be actually
    observed.  The tremendous success of theories produced by physicists over
    the centuries, such as Newton's Laws for Classical Mechanics, comes from the
    expression of these Laws into a very small set of equations, with
    consequences going way beyond the few examples that Newton himself, or the
    creators of other laws, investigated. Nevertheless, interpreting such laws
    as algorithms liable to be fed to a Turing Machine, the family of computable
    outcomes is automatically "small". Hence the family of data amenable to a
    physical interpretation is also automatically "small" compare to the
    information produced by Nature.


    To follow up on Finkelstein's claim, would require to check that the axioms of
    Quantum Mechanics are logically complete. This is what happened in the
    beginning of the 20th century: someone proved that the axioms of Arithmetic
    are logically complete. Then G\"odel used Arithmetic, the set of natural
    integers to reduce logic to a coding by integers and to prove the
    incompleteness of a set of axioms. If we could do something similar with
    either Quantum Mechanics, or with a simplified version sufficient to built
    the theory of quantum computation, then we could build a new logic with
    different rules, which could be implemented on a machine, that would allows
    to reach a much bigger set of data provided by Nature.


This is not the route followed by the physicists working on Quantum
Gravity.
\HREF{https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=xmOSptwAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate}
{Preskill} is writing a book on Quantum Computing including topological
quantum computation and also a very new chapter on quantum information,
following the path similar to the one proposed by Shannon in 1948.

The axioms of Arithmetic, namely the axioms describing the natural
integers where proposed by Peano in 1889, after several previous
proposals. Russell accepted them as suitable indeed to describe the set
of natural integers. Poincar\'e argued that before accepting them they need
to be proved to be consistent. By consistent, he meant that there are no
theorem based on this family of axioms leading to prove that 0=1. The
first proof of G\"odel incompleteness theorem in 1931, is based on Peano's
axioms. But the first proof of their consistency was provided by Gerhard
Gentzen in 1936, using a method called "transfinite induction" which is
supposed to be encodable by a Turing Machine. G\"odel himself gave a
different proof in 1958.

If you think just a little, we just cannot do anything without the set of
natural integers. So, at least for them, a proof of the consistence of
the axiom describing the integers is required.

It is unclear whether such a work could be done for the part of Quantum
Mechanics that is relevant for quantum computing. We do not need the
whole formalism for quantum computing, since quantum information is
reduced to qubits. It is sufficient to describe axioms using the qubits
only and the corresponding quantum gates. Since I haven't followed the
literature in this direction, it may happen that such axioms are already
available. I have no idea whether such axioms have been proved to be
consistents. But if they are, they might be a way to describe quantum
computing in terms of a quantum analog of Turing Machines (many proposals
can be found on the web, but I have no idea whether they are as radical
as David Finkelstein had in mind).

The length of this note: This is what happens when you learn a topic and
you haven't yet mastered it. The longer the explanation the more likely
the author is to be confused with the topic.
