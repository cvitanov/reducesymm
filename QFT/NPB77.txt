Known low-order contributions suggest that the entire QED
perturbation series for the electron magnetic moment is convergent.
This behaviour, which differs markedly from the recent asymptotic
estimates in various model quantum field theories, might be of
practical importance for high accuracy experimental tests of QED
and of theoretical importance for study of Yang-Mills theories.

1. Introduction

Reliable estimates of high -order radiative corrections in gauge
theories are of great importance, both practical (for example, for
the evaluation of the electron magnetic moment) and theoretical
(for example, for the study of the renormaliza­tion group function
~(g) in QeD confinement theories). I shall argue that on the basis
of the known low-order QED results the asymptotic estimates in
gauge theories should be radically different from those obtained in
scalar theories [1-5]. The cru­cial difference is that while in
scalar theories individual Feynman diagrams can be bounded, in
gauge theories only gauge-invariant sets of diagrams can have
bounds, and the size of a high-order contribution should be
controlled by the slowly grow­ing number of gauge-invariant sets,
rather than by the combinatorially exploding number of Feynman
diagrams. While it is commonly assumed [6,7] that in QED
gauge-invariant sets are bounded, no specific mechanism for this
bound has been proposed *. This reflects the long standing
frustration [8,9] associated with QED Feynman integrals: due to the
gauge dependence of individual diagrams, infmite renormalizations
and infrared divergences, we have no idea what size or even what
sign to expect for a given radiative correction. Explicit
calculations are marked by strong cancellations among diagrams
related by ,. gauge transformations, but we know of no way of
exploiting the underlying gauge symmetry to effect the
cancellations prior to an explicit evaluation of all contribut­ing
integrals. Even though such method is lacking, we can use the
experience from low-order QED calculations to conjecture that the
size of the 2nth order contribution in a gauge theory is bounded by
the number ofgauge-i11varian t subsets in 211tll order. A detailed
analysis of the electromagnetic moment will also suggest a stronger
hypo­thesis that in a "gauge set approximation" the magnetic moment
is convergent and summable to all orders: 1 _ a 1 (1) 2(g -2) =
a!:::< 21T (1 _ (a/1T)2)2 This is not meant to be an accurate
numerical approximation, but only a guide to the magnitude of the
2nth term, to be contrasted with the combinatorially growing
estimates of scalar field theory type [1-5]. The prediction for the
eighth order in this approximation is 0, with an accuracy guess of
±0.3. These error brackets are not to be taken too seriously, but
merely compared with a combinatorial estimate (10] of ±25. The
combinatorial estimate assumes that individual diagrams are
uncorrelated, with contributions statistically distributed around
zero with standard deviation ±l. I shall first review the results
of magnetic moment calculations and then contrast bounds based on
diagram counting with those based on gauge-set counting. A proof of
gauge invariance of gauge sets is outlined, as it might suggest a
method for establishing bounds on gauge sets. The paper closes with
a brief discussion of problems raised by the conjecture. 2.
Numerical results All contributions to the electron magnetic moment
anomaly a up to sixth order are known numerically (11-14] and most
also analytically [15]. They are written as Cl Cl)2 (Cl)3 a = a<2)

from all n-Ioop proper vertex diagrams. The second-order
contribution was first computed by Schwinger [16]

Analytic expressions for higher orders consist of many fractions
and transcedentals, and display no obvious systematics. The
numerical results for individual Feynman diagrams are likewise
confusing: they are dependent on the gauge and the method of
subtracting infrared divergences. As illustrated in
\reffig{Cvit77bFig2}, in practice they fall with·

in flO. Only the internally gauge-invariant sets [17] are
separately infrared finite and gauge independent. For them we
observe (i) Sets with photon self-energy subdiagrams are typically
±0.02 to ±O.I, Le. 3 to 15% of the corresponding sets without
photon self-energy insertions: creation of a virtual e + e -pair
suppresses the low-energy end of the virtual photon integrations,
leading to comparatively small contributions.

(ii)
Sets with electron loop subdiagrams with 4, 6, ... legs. In spite
of the above statement about e+e-pairs the only such set computed
so far, photon-photon scattering set, yields a comparatively large
contribution to a(6): 0.37. If this is caused by the nearly
ultraviolet divergent nature of photon-photon scattering dia­grams,
we can speculate that subdiagrams with 6, 8, ... photon legs will
again lead to small contributions, and that only some [6,18] of
4-photon leg sub diagram sets will be of a size comparable to sets
with no electron loops.


(iii) Sets without electron loops, hereafter referred to as gauge
sets, are listed in figs. I and 2_ A gauge set (k, m, m') consists
of all proper vertex diagrams without electron loops with k photons
crossing the external vertex (cross-photons) and m [m'] photons
originating and terminating on the incoming [outgoing] electron leg
(leg-photons), where m ~m', and for asymmetric sets (m *" m'), each
diagram and its mirror image belong to the same set. The gauge sets
of figs. I and 2 are all rough­ly ±0.5, with the sign given by a
simple empirical rule

The sign rule is further corroborated by sets with photon
self-energy insertions (but with the absolute size scaled down to
3-15% of (5), as mentioned above). In \reffig{Cvit77bFig3} I compare this rule
with the actual numbers and make an eighth-order prediction.

3. Counting of gauge sets and Feynman diagrams The extension of
\reffig{Cvit77bFig3} to arbitrary order is a matter of simple combinatorics * ;
in the "gauge-set approximation" the size of 2nth order term is
growing linearly Q ,,(Q)2(m-l) a~-LJ -m (6) 27T m= 1 7T -. with the
first few terms listed in table 1. This series is summable, with
the sum given
* An invaluable aid in identifying such combinatorial series is Sloane (19).

by (I). The estimate can be improved by. inclusion of sets with
electron loops, but the numerical results quoted above suggest that
they are non-leading or at worst comparable to the gauge-set
contributions, so I shall ignore all diagrams with electron loops
in the present paper. (My discussion applies only to electron QED;
the muon magnetic moment is characterized by the additional
parameter In (mJl/me), and sets with electron loops are actually
leading.

Even if the empirical rule (5) should turn out to be too naive, any
reasonable bound on the size of gauge sets will lead to a convergent
bound on the magnetic moment. This is clear from the growth of $G_{2n}$
, the number of gauge sets in 2nth order, which is easily
calculated by continuing \reffig{Cvit77bFig3} to higher orders. (The first few
terms are given in table 1). $G_{2n}$ to all orders can be written in

For example, if a bound on each gauge set is +1, with the
substitution X =O:/1T, (7) becomes a convergent bound on a. Let me
now contrast the above estimates with bounds b~sed on the counting
of individual Feynman diagrams_ Bender and Wu [20] have established
bounds on the size of the 2nth order contribution to the
anaharmonic oscillator energy levels by establishing bounds on
individual Feynman diagrams and then estimating their num­ber in
the 2nth order. Even though in QED individual Feynman diagrams are
clearly not bounded (because of infrared divergences) and not
independent (because gauge transformations mix them), the early
studies [21,22] of convergence properties of QED were also based on
diagram counting. I shall illustrate this type of a bound by
counting all diagrams (without electron loops) contributing to the

which follows from the perturbative expansion of fig. 4b. All
proper vertex diagrams are obtained by insertions of the external
photon into internal electron lines, hence their number is

(10)
with the first few orders listed in tabIe I.

Even though the number of independent diagrams is somewhat smaller
(I have not taken into account the symmetry under time reversal),
the combinatorial explosion in the number of diagrams is amply
evident. Such combinatorial growth in a number of diagrams is
characteristic of all quantum field theories, and any bound on the
size of individual diagrams (such as the assumption that their
values are statistically distributed around some average value)
leads to a perturbation series diver­gent for any IX i= O.

the magnetic moment anomaly and the renormalized proper vertex are
computed from M a=---(11) 1+ L '

(q2)'yv + F2(q2) (iaV"q ,,12m) , '~ and here rV is restricted to
the sum of all one-particle irreducible vertex diagrams without
electron loops. For this subset of diagrams Z 3 = I, and by the
Ward identity (Zl = Z2) Cl = ClO' so (II) and (12) are UV finite
without charge renormalization. The factor (I +L)-l = Z I arises
from the charge renormalization for the external vertex (or,
equivalently, from the renormalization of external electron lines).
(The diagrammatic expansion for rv already includes the electron
mass counterterms.) To expand the above quantities in terms of
gauge sets, assume temporarily that cross-photons, in-leg-photons
and out-leg-photons couple with different strengths.

Expanding M and L the same way we find from (II)

'-where the sums go over all gauge sets for which k = k I +k2 + .., + kl1 , and so on.
Gauge sets have the following properties:

(i) akmm' (and generally rfmm') is ultraviolet (UV) fillite
This follows from the standard UV analysis of each diagram G contributing to the set. UV singularities of G are of two types:
(a)
The divergent sub diagram S is an external photon vertex diagram. The UV divergence is cancelled by the Lsr~/s counterterm present in the expansion (14). (The notation is explained in refs. [23,24].)

(b)
The divergent vertex (self·energy) subdiagram lies entirely on the in· or out­electron leg. The gauge set rXmm' always includes the corresponding diagram with the divergent self·energy (vertex) subdiagram that cancels the first divergence by the Ward iden tity.


(ii) akmm' (butgenerally /lot rfmm') is infrared (IR) finite
MG is IR divergent whenever it can be separated into an external photon vertex subdiagram and a cloud of soft photons attached to the external lines. This IR di­
" .
vergence is cancelled by the counterterm AlsLG/s present [24] in expansion (I4).
(Incidentally, this similarity of UV and IR counterterms is an illustration of the
connection between the two types of divergences emphasized elsewhere [25].)

Con­venient diagrammatic notation is introduced in fig. 5, and interested readers can derive the linear gauge dependence of the r~mm' sets of \reffig{Cvit77bFig2} by inserting k" k" in all ways in the contributing diagrams and using the Feynman identity fig. 5b. The cancellations occur between diagrams related by symmetric insertion of the gauge photon around a photon vertex as illustrated in fig. 6, and the non·cancelled terms arise from two sources of asymmetry under photon interchange.
(a)
One·particle-irreducibility. Within a general gauge set there appears a sequence of diagrams of fig. 7. Two terms survive because the diagrams that should cancel them belong to the excluded set of self·energy corrections on the external line. How· ever, the first term yields upon evaluation an explicit factor 8m and is cancelled by the other (mass counterterm) term.

(b)
Separation into gauge sets. If photon i in fig. 6 is external, the cancelling dia­grams are in different gauge sets. Uncancelled terms arise from diagrams of the form of fig. 8a, with two possibilities.

(i)
The gauge photon is a leg·photol/, leading to a surviving term of the form fig. 8b. This has precisely the same gauge dependence as the mass counterterm fig. 8c, and gets cancelled (besides, any reasonable regularization sets this equal to zero).

(ii)
The gauge photon is a cross·photon, leading to a surviving term of the form fig. 8d. This is cancelled by the gauge dependence of the L 100 counterterm in the expansion (14).


The same cancellations operate between various counterterms in (14), leading to

diagram and generating the entire gauge set from it by requiring
that its gauge dependence be cancelled by the gauge dependence of
diagrams related to it by the rule of fig. 6.

5. Discussion

The "gauge-set hypothesis" and the rule (5) are merely attempts to
extract some suggestive information from the tremendous effort that
has gone into computing low-order radiative corrections in QED.
Some of tlfe weaknesses of above conjectures are:

(i)
The most glaring pitfall is the lack of a computational method for
implementing them. Of presently available techniques, the approach
of refs. [26,27] seems most suggestive; one can envisage
decompositions of cross-and leg-photon propaga­tors in which the
leading terms would add up to rule (5), and the remainder be shown
to be non-leading. Alternatively, rule (5) could be a consequence
of some semiclassical solution similar to those employed in scalar
theories [1-5].

(ii)
As far as the gauge invariance is concerned, gauge sets (k, m, m')
and (k, m', m), m *' m' could be counted as distinct.


(iii)
In the light of the rather large photon-photon scattering
contributions, it is not certain that diagrams with electron loops
will continue giving non-leading contributions.

(iv)
Why is Oi./rr and not 0i./4rr or something else the expansion
parameter? Scalar theory estimates suggest a dependence on 2n of a
much more complicated form than (1).

(v)
While no way of combining internally gauge invariant sets is known,
an externally gauge-invariant set [17] can be combined into a
single integral [12]. Mass­operator formalism yields the same
result [13]. Inspection of \reffig{Cvit77bFig2} shows that
externally gauge-invariant sets mix up gauge sets, and the origin
of rule (5) would seem very obscure in such an approach.


The convergence of the perturbation series (I) might also seem
surprising in the light of Dyson's [28] argument about the
non-analyticity of QED perturbation ex­pansions. However, it is
very hard to see what bearing his argument (about the breakdown of
the physical vacuum) has on a, which is defined as a formal Feynman
diagram series indifferent to the "true vacuum" of the theory.
Convergence of a is also not necessarily in contradiction with the
combinatorial growth of off-mass-shell Green functions suggested by
the work of Itzykson, Parisi and Zuber [4] on scalar QED. The
essential ingredients of a convergence. are gauge invariance and
mass-shell renormalization, and off-mass-shell Green functions are
both gauge and renormaliza­tion method dependent. In the absence of
a method for estimating the size of gauge set contributions it is
impossible to say whether the success of rule (5) is fortuitous,
but the importance of establishing a such or similar rule cannot be
overemphasized. The increase in the experimental accuracy of the
electron magnetic moment measurements [29] will soon confront us
with the necessity of computing a(8) if we wish to determine the
fine
" .
structure constant a: from OED. It is doubtful whether this can be
carried out with­in the Feynman diagram approach; the sixth-order
calculation already strains the limits of the computationally
possible. Numerical calculations [11-14] require large amounts of
computing time, and the analytic techniques [15], though very
impressive, are not yet sufficiently developed to cover even all
sixth-order contributions. The eighth-order calculation would
entail 891 diagrams [6] (and some 100 6th order counterterms), most
of which are as lengthy to compute as the entire sixth order!
If it is the gauge invariance that controls the asymptotic
estimates in QED, one would expect that it plays a similar role in
QeD. There, an asymptotic estimate of the infrared renormalization
group function {3 might resolve the important theoretical problem
of whether the low-energy effective coupling has any IR fixed
points, or if indeed it diverges as hypothesized by the advocates
of "infrared slavery" .
.

Note added in proof
Recently Lautrup [30] has shown that in the 2nth order the
contribution of the diagram with n -I electron loops grows as (n
-I)!. This is a general feature of renormalizable theories [31]. My
"gauge-set hypothesis" still applies to diagrams without electron
loops, but the full QED perturbation series for the magnetic
mo­ment will be divergent unless there occur further cancellations
among gauge invariant contributions to the photon propagator.
