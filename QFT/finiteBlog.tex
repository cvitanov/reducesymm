``The idea is to divide the process into appropriate gauge invariant
components. It turns out that the gauge invariant subsets are invariant
under cyclic permutations of the external gluons. This decomposition was
proposed in works of [58â€“61] for the tree level amplitudes. A thorough
analysis of the relation between color structures and gauge invariance
was done in \refref{NPB81}. The color decomposition principle was
extended beyond the tree level to loop amplitudes in [63].''

The decomposition of scattering amplitudes into gauge invariant subsets
of diagrams is studied by Boos and Ohl\rf{BBLOM94,BooOhl99}.

{\em Minimal gauge invariant classes of tree diagrams in gauge theories},
\arXiv{hep-ph/9903357} (see \arXiv{hep-ph/9911437} and
\arXiv{hep-ph/0307057} for more detail) is motivated by applications to
Standard Model multi-particle diagrams, mostly at the tree level.

Perturbative calculations require an explicit breaking of gauge
invariance for technical reasons and the cancellation of unphysical
contributions is not manifest in intermediate stages of calculations. The
contribution of a particular Feynman diagram to a scattering amplitude
depends in the gauge fixing procedure and has no physical meaning.
the identification of partial sums of Feynman diagrams that are gauge
invariant by themselves is of great practical importance.
Calculation a subset of diagrams that is not gauge invariant has no
predictive power, because they depend on unphysical parameters introduced
during the gauge fixing.

A \emph{gauge invariance class} is a minimal subset of Feynman diagrams
that is independent of the gauge parameter and satisfies the
Slavnov-Taylor identities.

The set of diagrams connected by flavor and gauge flips they call
\emph{forest}, a set of diagrams connected by gauge flips the call
\emph{grove}. They shown that the groves are the minimal gauge invariance
classes of tree Feynman diagrams. In unbroken gauge theories, the
permutation symmetry of external gauge quantum numbers can be used to
subdivide the scattering amplitude corresponding to a grove further into
gauge invariant sub-amplitudes.

This (largely uncited) work seems to have no impact on the $(g-2)$
gauge sets discussed here.

Reuschle and Weinzierl\rf{ReuWei13} {\em Decomposition of one-loop {QCD}
amplitudes into primitive amplitudes based on shuffle relations}
cite our \refref{NPB81}. They say:

QCD calculations organise the computation of the one-loop amplitude as a sum
over smaller pieces, called \emph{primitive amplitudes}.
The most important features of a primitive amplitude are gauge invariance
and a fixed cyclic ordering of the external legs.
Primitive amplitudes should not be confused with \emph{partial amplitudes}
(also referred to as a \emph{dual amplitude} or a \emph{color-ordered amplitude}),
which are the kinematic coefficients of the independent colour
structures.
The first step in a discussion of perturbative Yang-Mills is the
decoupling of color from kinematics,
\beq
A_{tot} = \sum c_J A_J
\ee{KolShi14(1.1)}
where $A_{tot}$ represents the total amplitude for a scattering process,
$A_J $ are all the possible color structures,
and $A_J$ are partial amplitudes which depend only on the kinematical data
(momenta and polarizations).
Partial amplitudes are gauge invariant, but not
necessarily cyclic ordered.
Partial amplitudes are far simpler to calculate than the
full amplitude. There
exist linear relations among the partial amplitudes, called
Kleiss-Kuijf relations, which reduce the number of linearly
independent partial amplitudes to $(n-2)!$
The leading contributions in an $1/N$-expansion (with $N$ being the number of colours)
are usually cyclic ordered, the sub-leading parts are in general not.
The decomposition of the full one-loop amplitude into partial amplitudes is easily derived.
However, it is less trivial to find a decomposition of the partial
amplitudes into primitive amplitudes.

There are several possible choices for a basis in colour space.
A convenient choice is the colour-flow basis\rf{tHooft:1974jz}.

Kol and Shir\rf{KolShi14,KolShi15}
{\em Color structures and permutations} has a
useful overview of the literature in the introduction, and is a very
interesting read overall.

We may permute (or re-label) the external legs in the expression for a
color structure and thereby obtain another color structure. This means
that the space of color structures is a representation of $S_n$, the
group of permutations. A natural question is to characterize this
representation including its character and its decomposition into
irreducible representations (irreps).

The decomposition of color structures into irreps was suggested by
Zeppenfeld\rf{Zeppenfeld88}.

The space of tree-level color structures $TCS_n$ of dimension
\beq
\mbox{dim}(TCS_n) = (n-2)!
\ee{KolShi14(2.7)}
is the vector space
generated by all diagrams with $n$ external legs and an oriented cubic
vertex, which are connected and without loops (trees), where diagrams
which differ by the Jacobi identity are to be identified.

The $f$-based and $t$-based color structures are related by celebrated
Kleiss-Kuijf\rf{KleKui89} relations (rederived in this paper).

The original problem, that of capturing symmetries of the partial
amplitudes which originate with those of the color structures, is now
formulated as the problem of obtaining the $S_n$ character
of the space of color structures. It turns out that (at least at
tree level) this problem was fully solved in the mathematics literature
by Getzler and M. M. Kapranov\rf{GetKap98}.

The free Lie algebra over some set $A$, denoted by $L(A)$, is the Lie
algebra generated by $A$ with no further relations apart for antisymmetry
and the Jacobi identity which are mandated by definition.

Self duality under Young conjugation: for some $n$ values $TCS_n$  is
self-dual under Young conjugation, namely under the interchange of rows
and columns in the Young diagrams

which generalizes Kontsevich's graph complexes and also the bar
construction for operads. We calculate the Euler characteristic of the
Feynman transform, using the theory of symmetric functions: our formula
is modelled on Wick's theorem.

Maltoni \etal\rf{MPSW03}
{\em Color-flow decomposition of {QCD} amplitudes}

The \emph{color-flow} decomposition is based on treating the $SU(N)$
gluon field as an $N\!\times\!N$ matrix.
(PC: I think that is what I actually do.)
It has several nice features.
First, a similar decomposition exists for all multiparton amplitudes,
like the fundamental-representation decomposition. Second, the color-flow
decomposition allows for a very efficient calculation of multiparton
amplitudes. Third, it is a very natural way to decompose a QCD amplitude.
As the name suggests, it is based on the flow of color, so the
decomposition has a simple physical interpretation.

To calculate the amplitude, one orders the gluons clockwise, and draws
color-flow lines, with color flowing counterclockwise, connecting
adjacent gluons. One then deforms the color-flow lines in all possible
ways to form the Feynman diagrams that contribute to this partial
amplitude. The Feynman diagrams that contribute to a partial amplitude
are planar. This is not due to an expansion in $1/N$; the partial
amplitudes are exact. They note (see their Table 1) that the number of
Feynman diagrams contributing to an $n$-gluon partial amplitude grows as
$\approx 3 \cdot 8^n$. In contrast, the number of Feynman diagrams
contributing to the full amplitude grows factorially, as
$\approx (2n)!$.

{\em Quark-gluon vertex: {A} perturbation theory primer and beyond},
\arXiv{1702.04437}:
The on-shell limit enables us to compute anomalous chromomagnetic moment
of quarks.

[...] we present some ``physically" relevant results for
the on-shell limit $p^2=k^2=m^2$ and $q^2=0$. The Dirac and Pauli
form factors, $F_1(q^2)$ and $F_2(q^2)$, respectively, define the
Gordon decomposition of the quark current as in \refeq{BAGTB17(35-1)}.
The anomalous chromomagnetic moment (ACM) of quarks can be
identified as $F_2(q^2)$ for $q^2 \rightarrow 0$. The Abelian
version of this decomposition with $C_F=1$ and $C_A=0$ is the
electron-photon vertex of quantum electrodynamics. The great
successes of the Dirac equation is the prediction of the magnetic
moment of a charged fermion  ${ {\mu}} = {eg}/{(2 m)} { S}$.
The radiative corrections lead to\rf{Schwinger48}
 \bea
 \frac{e}{2 m} \Rightarrow \left( 1 + \frac{\alpha}{2 \pi} \right) \frac{e}{2
 m}.
 \eea
Note that the quark-gluon vertex differs from the electron-photon vertex
already at one loop, by the contributions of an additional Feynman
diagram, involving the triple-gluon vertex. In fact, apart from
introducing additional color structure, this non-Abelian diagram
introduces, at the one-loop level, a kinematical structure which is
absent in the QED.

It is straightforward to see that for the soft gluon limit, $q^2=0$, the
Abelian contribution for the ACM reduces to the non-Abelian counterpart
of Schwinger's result, $F_{2}^{a}(0) = - \alpha /12 \pi$, already derived
in \refref{ChLiRo11}. On the other hand, the corresponding non-Abelian
contribution yields a divergence\rf{ChoLah15}, for a non-zero quark mass,
$m \neq 0$. We find this divergence to be logarithmic. For deep infrared
gluon momenta it behaves as $F_2^{b}(q^2 \rightarrow 0)= C_b \ln \left( -
q^2/m^2 \right)$. Of course, perturbation theory in QCD is not the way to
explore deep infrared region. All perturbative conclusions will be taken
over by non-perturbative effects, overshadowing this divergence.

\subsection{Quenched QED/QFT}
\label{sect:quenched QE}
\begin{description}
\item[2013-11-24  Predrag]
As far as I can tell, terminology ``of \emph{quenched} type'' was first
introduced in this context by
Marinari, Parisi and Rebbi\rf{MaPaRe81}
{\em {Monte Carlo} simulation of the massive {Schwinger} model},
in the context of lattice gauge theory. They write:
``A first approximation to the effect of the gauge field on the fermion
observables may be achieved by [...] neglecting the contributions from
the fermionic vacuum polarization diagrams and, using a terminology
developed in the theory of condensed matter, we shall call the
expectation values thus obtained `quenched'",

Parisi is reputable, so in the ``quenched approximation" one neglects
the fermionic vacuum polarization effects (i.e, the fermion loops) from
the fermion determinant in the effective action. If it is good enough for Kinoshita,
it is good enough for you.

``In the `quenched approximation' the quark determinant is set equal to
unity, i.e., neglecting the effect of virtual quark loops. In
other words, this extreme approximation in terms of heavy quarks with a
vanishing number of flavors assumes that gauge fields affect quarks while
quarks have no dynamical effect on gauge fields."

A more general usage: ``In Quantum Cosmology ``quenching,'' amounts to
quantizing a single scale factor thereby selecting a class of
cosmological models, for instance, the Friedmann-Robertson-Walker
space-time while neglecting the quantum fluctuations of the full
metric.''

But I still do not like it - it is mostly associated with Kogut, where it
means something different (as in ``... treating the gauge interaction in
the quenched, planar (ladder) approximation"); search for quench
\HREF{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_chromodynamics} {here}. Or
here is what Brezin says:

``concept of quenching is well-known in the statistical mechanics of
random media ; consider a system of particles, for instance, an electron
gas, interacting with impurities. If these impurities are mobile, they
will thermalize with the electron gas and the average physical quantities
are obtained by a trace over the electron gas and the impurities degrees
of freedom. However if the impurities are frozen, the `quenched' case,
the physical observables are obtained by calculating their value for
fixed impurities and then averaging over these
impurities. "

That is how I know it - nothing about fermion loops, just dirt physics...

From my point of view, the question is whether the sum of all
corrections to (g-2) is a convergent series, or an asymptotic one.
If on can prove the convergence for the quenched sector, I would
expect each un-quenched sector (diagrams with one, two, .... lops)
separately to be convergent, and their sum as well.

Here is something to amuse you:

\item[1950-12-22 Schwinger]
{\em On gauge invariance and vacuum polarization}\rf{Schwinger51c}
has 3700 citations.
He writes: ``
This paper is based on the elementary remark that the extraction of gauge
invariant results from a formally gauge invariant theory is ensured if
one employs methods of solution that involve only gauge covariant
quantities. We illustrate this statement in connection with the problem
of vacuum polarization by a prescribed electromagnetic field. The vacuum
current of a charged Dirac field, which can be expressed in terms of the
Green's function of that field, implies an addition to the action
integral of the electromagnetic field. Now these quantities can be
related to the dynamical properties of a ``particle" with space-time
coordinates that depend upon a proper-time parameter. The proper-time
equations of motion involve only electromagnetic field strengths, and
provide a suitable gauge invariant basis for treating problems. Rigorous
solutions of the equations of motion can be obtained for a constant
field, and for a plane wave field. A renormalization of field strength
and charge, applied to the modified lagrange function for constant
fields, yields a finite, gauge invariant result which implies nonlinear
properties for the electromagnetic field in the vacuum.
[...]
one can employ an expansion in powers of the potential vector. The latter
automatically yields gauge invariant results, provided only that the
proper-time integration is reserved to the last. This indicates that the
significant aspect of the proper-time method is its isolation of
divergences in integrals with respect to the proper-time parameter, which
is independent of the coordinate system and of the gauge. The connection
between the proper-time method and the technique of ``invariant
regularization" is discussed. Incidentally, the probability of actual
pair creation is obtained from the imaginary part of the electromagnetic
field action integral. Finally, as an application of the Green's function
for a constant field, we construct the mass operator of an electron in a
weak, homogeneous external field, and derive the additional spin magnetic
moment of $\alpha/2\pi$ magnetons by means of a perturbation calculation
in which proper-mass plays the customary role of energy.

{\em {Euler-Heisenberg} lagrangians and asymptotic analysis in 1+1 {QED. Part I: Two}-loop}
(no GaTech online access, \arXiv{1010.5315}):``
We continue an effort to obtain information on the QED perturbation
series at high loop orders, and particularly on the issue of large
cancellations inside gauge invariant classes of graphs, using the example
of the l-loop N-photon amplitudes in the limit of large photon
numbers and low photon energies. The high-order
information on these amplitudes can be obtained from a nonperturbative
formula, due to Affleck \etal\rf{AffAlMa82}, for the imaginary part of the QED
effective lagrangian in a constant field. The procedure uses Borel
analysis and leads, under some plausible assumptions, to a number of
nontrivial predictions already at the three-loop level. Their direct
verification would require a calculation of this `Euler-Heisenberg
lagrangian' at three-loops, which seems presently out of reach
(though see Huet, de Traubenberg, and Schubert\rf{HuTrSc17} below). Motivated
by previous work by Dunne and Krasnansky\rf{DunKra06} on Euler-Heisenberg
Lagrangians in various dimensions, in the present work we initiate a new
line of attack on this problem by deriving and proving the analogous
predictions in the simpler setting of 1+1 dimensional QED. In the first
part of this series, we obtain a generalization of the formula of
Affleck \etal\rf{AffAlMa82}
to this case, and show that, for both scalar and spinor QED, it
correctly predicts the leading asymptotic behaviour of the weak field
expansion coefficients of the two loop Euler-Heisenberg lagrangians.

``The present work continues an
effort\rf{DunSch02I,DunSch02II,MaScVi03,DunSch06} to study the multiloop
behaviour of the QED $N$-photon amplitudes using the QED effective
lagrangian, and in particular to prove or disprove Cvitanovi\'c's
conjecture for these amplitudes.''

{\em Integral representations combining ladders and crossed-ladders}
write:

This property is particularly interesting in view of the fact that it is
just this type of summation which in QED often leads to extensive
cancellations, and to final results which are substantially simpler than
intermediate ones (see, e.g., \refref{Cvit77b,BrDeKr96}). More recently, similar
cancellations have been found also for graviton amplitudes (see, e.g.,
\refref{BaBjVa09}).
Although this property of the worldline formalism is well-known, and has
been occasionally exploited\rf{rossch96a,rossch96b, SchSch96,BaRoSt06} (see also
\refref{FriGab12}) a systematic study of its implications is
presently still lacking.

The first classes of Green's functions %, depicted in fig. \ref{fig:Nprop},
is the
$x$-space propagator for one scalar interacting with the second one
through the exchange of $N$ given momenta.

This object, to be called ``$N$-propagator'', is given by a set of $N!$
simple tree-level graphs, is in the worldline formalism combined into a
single integral.

The second class are the similarly looking  $x$-space $N+2$ - point
functions %shown in fig \ref{fig:halfladder},
defined by a line connecting
the points $x$ and $y$ and $N$ further points $z_1,\ldots,z_N$ connecting
to this line in an arbitrary order.

An advantage of the worldline representation over the usual Feynman
parameterization is the automatic inclusion of all possible ways of
crossing the ``rungs'' of the ladders. They obtain such representations
in explicit form both in $x$-space and in momentum space.

The inclusion of the crossed ladder graphs is essential for the
consistency of the one-body limit where one of the constituents becomes
infinitely heavy, and for maintaining gauge invariance.

They concentrate on the case of infinite $N$, \hbox{\it i.e.}, the sum
over {\it all} ladder {\it and} crossed ladder graphs.

As their main application, they consider the case of two massive scalars
interacting through the exchange of a massless scalar, obtain an the case
of a massless exchanged particle (along the ``rungs'' of the ladders).

Applying
asymptotic estimates and a saddle-point approximation to the $N$-rung
ladder plus crossed ladder diagrams, they derive a semi-analytic
approximation formula for the lowest bound state mass in this model.

They use the worldline formalism to derive integral representations for
the $N$-propagators and the $N$-ladders - in scalar field theory,
and give a compact expression combining the $N!$ Feynman diagrams
contributing to the amplitude. They give these representations in both
$x$ and (off-shell) momentum space. Being off-shell, can be used
as building blocks for more complex amplitudes. They derive a
compact expression for the sum of all ladder graphs with $N$ rungs,
including all possible crossings of the rungs.

Nieuwenhuis and Tjon\rf{NieTjo96} 1996 have numerically evaluated the path
integrals of the worldline representation for the same scalar model field
theory, thus including all ladder {\it and}
crossed ladder graphs.

expressions have been conjectured for the pair creation rate in the weak
field limit, for scalar QED in 1982 by Affleck, Alvarez, and
Manton\rf{AffAlMa82}, and for spinor QED by Lebedev and
Ritus\rf{LebRit84} in 1984. Using Borel analysis, these can be used to
obtain non-perturbative information on the on-shell renormalized N-photon
amplitudes at large N and low energy.''

``there is something quite implausible about it: a summation to all loop
orders has produced the perfectly analytic factor $e^{\alpha\pi}$! This is
certainly contrary to standard QED wisdom''

Preliminary results of a calculation of the three-loop Euler--Heisenberg
Lagrangian in two dimensions indicate that the exponentiation conjecture
by Affleck \etal\ and Lebedev/Ritus probably fails in $D = 2$.

Dunne and Schubert conjectured in 2005 that the QED $N-$photon amplitudes
in the quenched (one electron loop) approximation are convergent in
perturbation theory\rf{DunSch06}. In this article they say; ``Later they learned

has a finite, nonzero radius of convergence if $|A_N|$ grows
exponentially. So maybe there remains some hope for some form of

``The summation over all insertions requires considering \emph{connected}
rather then one-particle irreducible Feynman graphs.''

In his (unpublished) thesis Henry defines the above ``self-energy set" as
an ``equivalence class'' obtained by all insertions of an external
electron-photon vertex into the external electron line propagator of a
self-energy graph. On mass-shell the summation over this class is gauge
invariant by the Ward-Takahashi identity\rf{Ward50,Takahashi57}.

This gets more interesting when he considers insertion of internal
photon propagator ``gaugeons" (a Lautrup name?). Then, for example
(his eq.~(2.75)) the sum of all connected quenched 2-loop graphs
is equivalent to the one-loop self energy. Perhaps iteration of
such insertions into Schwinger 1-loop anomaly might offer a proof
of invariance of gauge sets...

``
The four-photon interaction is called light-by-light scattering and
supposed to be finite by renormalizability --in other words there is no
interaction vertex in Quantum Electrodynamics that could serve to absorb
the divergences of the four-photon type. Unfortunately, the author is not
aware of a general argument beyond the first-loop order that proves this
statement. In \arXiv{1406.1618} and \arXiv{1703.01094}, a basis of
Lorentz tensors was construct for the class four-photon graphs; it
consists of 138 Lorentz tensors and the challenge is to show that each
coefficient becomes finite when all graphs at a certain loop order are
considered.
''

He  shows that the sum over all one-particle irreducible four-photon
graphs is transversal (it vanishes whenever one of its external legs is
contracted with the associated momentum). This global property restricts
the possible occurrence of divergences to 43 Lorentz tensors (see
\arXiv{1505.06336} for an alternative basis of Lorentz tensors which
includes the anti-symmetry tensor), whose coefficients remain to be
proven finite.

They discuss how the QED tree-level cancellation identity implies
cancellation between Feynman graphs of different topologies and
determines the gauge dependence. They parameterize the momentum part of
Landau gauge, then start by keeping only a liner term in graphs (\ie,
insert only one Landau propagator, rest Feynman).
They focus on the electron propagator in the massless limit of Quantum
Electrodynamics.
Not sure it is useful

Phys. 14, 435 (1955) [8] to a relativistic  scalar  field  theory  and

variational approximation of the resulting effective action by a retarded
quadratic trial action. In recent work we have extended this approach to
more realistic theories, in particular to quenched QED\rf{AlRoSc00} (the
divergence structure and renormalization, a compact expression for the
anomalous mass dimension of the electron). Here they calculate the finite
contributions.

The variational formulation of worldline QED leads to an equation which
is similar to Abraham, Lorentz and Dirac description of the electron and
its self-interaction with the radiation field. The approach contains
(almost) all the ingredients of the relativistic field theory of
electrons and photons, in particular its divergence structure. This has
been demonstrated by deriving an approximate nonperturbative expression

{\em Remarks on the effect of bound states and threshold in $g$-2}:
``
The appearance of positronium poles in a photon propagator in QED
formally requires a summation of an infinite series of terms in
perturbation theory. [...] we show how these nonperturbative
contributions disappear, using the case of the electron anomalous
magnetic moment as an example. [...] it never happens that a summation of
infinite classes of Feynman diagrams enhanced at any threshold generates
additional effects beyond perturbation theory. The misunderstanding of
this fact appears to be quite common.

{\em The {R*}-operation for {Feynman} graphs with generic numerators}:
``The R*-operation by Chetyrkin, Tkachov, and Smirnov is a generalisation
of the BPHZ R-operation, which subtracts both ultraviolet and infrared
divergences of euclidean Feynman graphs with non-exceptional external
momenta. It can be used to compute the divergent parts of such Feynman
graphs from products of simpler Feynman graphs of lower loops. In this
paper we extend the R*-operation to Feynman graphs with arbitrary
numerators, including tensors. We also provide a novel way of defining
infrared counterterms which closely resembles the definition of its
ultraviolet counterpart. We further express both infrared and ultraviolet
counterterms in terms of scaleless vacuum graphs with a logarithmic
degree of divergence. By exploiting symmetries, integrand and integral
relations, which the counterterms of scaleless vacuum graphs satisfy, we
can vastly reduce their number and complexity.''

A closer reading of sect.~6. {\em Worldline formalism} of Gelis and N.
Tanji\rf{GelTan16} {\em Schwinger mechanism revisited} might be helpful - it
goes to the barycenter to reexpress the integral as an average over Wilson
loops.

In sect.~6.4. {\em Lattice worldline formalism} they describe a
formulation of the worldline formalism the (Euclidean) spaceâ€“time
discretized on a cubic lattice  [113â€“116].

Schmidt and Stamatescu\rf{SchSta03,SchSta03a} {\em Matter determinants in
background fields using random walk world line loops on the lattice},
using Schwinger's propert time formalism, pointed out that the fermion and
boson determinant on the lattice can be viewed as a gas of closed loops
which can be simulated numerically via a random walk.

Seiler and Stamatescu\rf{SeiSta16}
{\em A note on the loop formula for the fermionic determinant}: ``
A formula expressing the fermionic determinant as an infinite product of
smaller determinants is derived and discussed. These smaller determinants are
of a fixed size, independent of the size of the lattice and are indexed by
loops of increasing length.

We will discuss in more detail the derivation of the formula as well as its
limitations and possible misunderstandings in using it, since one might think
that the zeroes of the determinant are given by the zeroes of the factors of
the product. In fact this is not the case, and the formula should instead be
understood as a systematic approximation.

In particular, for a finite lattice this formula expresses the determinant
which is a polynomial of finite order in the hopping parameter as an infinite
product. Obviously this can make sense only where the infinite product
converges, which is equivalent to convergence of the expansion of its
logarithm; this convergence will break down at the latest at the first zero
encountered, either on the left-hand side (lhs) or in one of the factors on
the right-hand side (rhs).

Turns out this is the same discussion as my discussion of the Euler product
representation fo dynamical $\zeta$ functions in \wwwcb{}.

Fry\rf{Fry15} {\em Nonperturbative quantization of the electroweak model's
electrodynamic sector}: `` Consider the Euclidean functional integral
representation of any physical process in the electroweak model. Integrating
out the fermion degrees of freedom introduces 24 fermion determinants.
Suppose the functional integral over the Maxwell field is attempted first.
This paper is concerned with the large amplitude behavior of the Maxwell
effective measure. We examine the large amplitude variation of a single QED
fermion determinant. To facilitate this the Schwinger proper time
representation of this determinant is decomposed into a sum of three terms.
The advantage of this is that the separate terms can be nonperturbatively
estimated for a measurable class of large amplitude random fields in four
dimensions. It is found that the QED fermion determinant grows to fast in the
absence. Including zero mode supporting background potentials can result in a
decaying exponential growth of the fermion determinant. This is prima facie
evidence that Maxwellian zero modes are necessary for the nonperturbative
quantization of QED

Gies and Langfeld\rf{GieLan02} {\em Loops and loop clouds â€” a numerical
approach to the worldline formalism in {QED}}
point out that the fermion (and boson) determinant on the lattice can be
viewed as a gas of closed loops which can be simulated numerically via a
random walk: ``
A numerical technique for calculating effective actions of electromagnetic
backgrounds is proposed, which is based on the string-inspired worldline
formalism. As examples, we consider scalar electrodynamics in three and four
dimensions to one-loop order. Beyond the constant-magnetic-field case, we
analyze a step-function-like magnetic field exhibiting a nonlocal and
nonperturbative phenomenon: ``magnetic-field diffusion".

{\em Lattice worldline representation of correlators in a background field}: ``
We use a discrete worldline representation in order to study the continuum
limit of the one-loop expectation value of dimension two and four local
operators in a background field. We illustrate this technique in the case of
a scalar field coupled to a non-Abelian background gauge field. The first two
coefficients of the expansion in powers of the lattice spacing can be
expressed as sums over random walks on a d-dimensional cubic lattice. Using
combinatorial identities for the distribution of the areas of closed random
walks on a lattice, these coefficients can be turned into simple integrals.
Our results are valid for an anisotropic lattice, with arbitrary lattice
spacings in each direction.

homomorphisms from a lattice to the structure group, a consistent interaction
measure and an infinite-dimensional calculus have been constructed for a
theory of non-Abelian generalized connections on a hypercubic lattice. Here,
after reviewing and clarifying past work, new results are obtained for the

{\em Scattering amplitudes for all masses and spins}: ``
We introduce a formalism for describing four-dimensional scattering
amplitudes for particles of any mass and spin. This naturally extends the
familiar spinor-helicity formalism for massless particles to one where these
variables carry an extra SU(2) little group index for massive particles, with
the amplitudes for spin S particles transforming as symmetric rank 2S
tensors. We systematically characterise all possible three particle
amplitudes compatible with Poincare symmetry. [...]

We illustrate a number of
applications of the formalism at one-loop, giving few-line computations of
the electron (g-2) as well as the beta function and rational terms in QCD.
``Off-shell" observables like correlation functions and form-factors can be
thought of as scattering amplitudes with external "probe" particles of
general mass and spin, so all these objects--amplitudes, form factors and
correlators, can be studied from a common on-shell perspective.

We have not forgotten about g-2 here, my student Misha is working on the

and orbit parts. My big hope is that not all will equally contribute for
large $N$.

Last week James and I were in Bologna where we had an opportunity to talk
to Remiddi. He seems not terribly interested in the convergence issue,
but in any case he said he would find nothing odd if that happened to be
true, since the issue of cancellations is so little understood.
