{\em Anomalous magnetic moment of the electron, muon, and nucleon}

magnitude of the sixth-order magnetic moment;
$0.15 \left(\frac{\alpha}{\pi}\right)^3$ instead of
$1.19 \left(\frac{\alpha}{\pi}\right)^3$.

``We speculate that in making radiative corrections to a class of graphs
by inserting a single photon in all possible ways, one obtains a
contribution which is roughly $-\frac{\alpha}{\pi}$ times the
contribution of the class. This seems to be obeyed by the known
contributions.''

I'm no fan of Feynman diagrams (my rant is
\HREF{http://www.cns.gatech.edu/~predrag/papers/preprints.html\#FiniteFieldTheo}
{here}), and I'm always looking
for other ways to look at perturbative expansions. So just a little email
- if you have a new angle\rf{PrAlCz13} on subsets of diagrams which are gauge
invariant sets, I would be curious to learn how you look at that.

Just something to keep in mind :)

PS to Andrea: I realize you might rather forget this stuff (takes you a
decade to write a paper?) but at least I got a ringtone out of you. The
only problem is, I do not have a cell phone, so I do not know how to make
it ring. At least I'm more technologically savvy than

Sorry for late reply (well, we're used to longer gaps). Yes! I actually
took 10 years to write this paper out of my master thesis, but I have
some excuses: I did my PhD in Biochemistry (Z\"urich) and now I work on
genetics (Lausanne). This summer my ``old'' professor Wanda found my work
in a drawer and then contacted me, telling me that it would be a good
idea to publish it.

About your request: I'm really interested in seeing if the rooted-map
approach to Feynman diagrams can address the problem you've risen. But I
have no idea what the ''subsets of diagrams which are gauge invariant
sets'' are. I've checked a bit on the web but I'm sure you can give me
better indications (the works I found were too technical: I need to know
the basis of the problem). Can you send me some specific link at freshman
level, in particular where I can see the geometry of these subclasses of
diagrams?

They write: ``
The  Rooted Maps Theory, a branch of the Theory of Homology, is shown to be
a powerful tool for investigating  the topological properties of Feynman
diagrams, related to the single particle propagator in the quantum many-body
systems. The numerical correspondence between the number of this class of
Feynman diagrams as a function of perturbative order and the number of rooted
maps as a function of the number of edges is studied. A graphical procedure to
associate Feynman diagrams and rooted maps is then stated. Finally, starting
from rooted maps principles, an original definition of the genus of a
Feynman diagram, which totally differs from the usual one, is given.

{\em {Euler-Heisenberg} lagrangians and asymptotic analysis in 1+1 {QED. Part I: Two}-loop}
(no GaTech online access, \arXiv{1010.5315}):``
We continue an effort to obtain information on the QED perturbation
series at high loop orders, and particularly on the issue of large
cancellations inside gauge invariant classes of graphs, using the example
of the l-loop N-photon amplitudes in the limit of large photon
numbers and low photon energies. The high-order
information on these amplitudes can be obtained from a nonperturbative
formula, due to Affleck \etal\rf{AffAlMa82}, for the imaginary part of the QED
effective lagrangian in a constant field. The procedure uses Borel
analysis and leads, under some plausible assumptions, to a number of
nontrivial predictions already at the three-loop level. Their direct
verification would require a calculation of this `Euler-Heisenberg
lagrangian' at three-loops, which seems presently out of reach
(though see Huet, de Traubenberg, and Schubert\rf{HuTrSc17} below). Motivated
by previous work by Dunne and Krasnansky\rf{DunKra06} on Euler-Heisenberg
lagrangians in various dimensions, in the present work we initiate a new
line of attack on this problem by deriving and proving the analogous
predictions in the simpler setting of 1+1 dimensional QED. In the first
part of this series, we obtain a generalization of the formula of
Affleck \etal\rf{AffAlMa82}
to this case, and show that, for both scalar and spinor QED, it
correctly predicts the leading asymptotic behaviour of the weak field
expansion coefficients of the two loop Euler-Heisenberg lagrangians.

Bastianelli, Huet, Schubert, Thakur and Weber\rf{BHSTW14} 2014
{\em Integral representations combining ladders and crossed-ladders}
write:

This property is particularly interesting in view of the fact that it is
just this type of summation which in QED often leads to extensive
cancellations, and to final results which are substantially simpler than
intermediate ones (see, e.g., \refref{Cvit77b,BrDeKr96}). More recently, similar
cancellations have been found also for graviton amplitudes (see, e.g.,
\refref{BaBjVa09}).
Although this property of the worldline formalism is well-known, and has
been occasionally exploited\rf{rossch96a,rossch96b, SchSch96,BaRoSt06} (see also
\refref{FriGab12}) a systematic study of its implications is
presently still lacking.

The first classes of Green's functions %, depicted in fig. \ref{fig:Nprop},
is the
$x$-space propagator for one scalar interacting with the second one
through the exchange of $N$ given momenta.

This object, to be called ``$N$-propagator'', is given by a set of $N!$
simple tree-level graphs, is in the worldline formalism combined into a
single integral.

The second class are the similarly looking  $x$-space $N+2$ - point
functions %shown in fig \ref{fig:halfladder},
defined by a line connecting
the points $x$ and $y$ and $N$ further points $z_1,\ldots,z_N$ connecting
to this line in an arbitrary order.

An advantage of the worldline representation over the usual Feynman
parameterization is the automatic inclusion of all possible ways of
crossing the ``rungs'' of the ladders. They obtain such representations
in explicit form both in $x$-space and in momentum space.

The inclusion of the crossed ladder graphs is essential for the
consistency of the one-body limit where one of the constituents becomes
infinitely heavy, and for maintaining gauge invariance.

They concentrate on the case of infinite $N$, \hbox{\it i.e.}, the sum
over {\it all} ladder {\it and} crossed ladder graphs.

As their main application, they consider the case of two massive scalars
interacting through the exchange of a massless scalar, obtain an the case
of a massless exchanged particle (along the ``rungs'' of the ladders).

Applying
asymptotic estimates and a saddle-point approximation to the $N$-rung
ladder plus crossed ladder diagrams, they derive a semi-analytic
approximation formula for the lowest bound state mass in this model.

They use the worldline formalism to derive integral representations for
the $N$-propagators and the $N$-ladders - in scalar field theory,
and give a compact expression combining the $N!$ Feynman diagrams
contributing to the amplitude. They give these representations in both
$x$ and (off-shell) momentum space. Being off-shell, can be used
as building blocks for many more complex amplitudes. They derive a
compact expression for the sum of all ladder graphs with $N$ rungs,
including all possible crossings of the rungs.

Nieuwenhuis and Tjon\rf{NieTjo96} 1996 have numerically evaluated the path
integrals of the worldline representation for the same scalar model field
theory that we are considering here, thus including all ladder {\it and}
crossed ladder graphs.

{\em Multiloop {Euler-\,Heisenberg Lagrangians, Schwinger} pair creation,
and the photon {S-matrix}}:
``Schwinger pair creation in a constant electric field, may possibly
provide a window to high loop orders; simple non-perturbative closed-form
expressions have been conjectured for the pair creation rate in the weak
field limit, for scalar QED in 1982 by Affleck, Alvarez, and
Manton\rf{AffAlMa82}, and for spinor QED by Lebedev and
Ritus\rf{LebRit84} in 1984. Using Borel analysis, these can be used to
obtain non-perturbative information on the on-shell renormalized N-photon
amplitudes at large N and low energy.''


Preliminary results of a calculation of the three-loop Euler--Heisenberg
Lagrangian in two dimensions indicate that the exponentiation conjecture
by Affleck \etal\ and Lebedev/Ritus probably fails in $D = 2$.

Dunne and Schubert conjectured in 2005 that the QED $N-$photon amplitudes
in the quenched (one electron loop) approximation are convergent in
perturbation theory\rf{DunSch06}. In this article they say; ``Later they learned
that Cvitanovi\'c in 1977 had already made the analogous conjecture for
$(g-2)$\rf{Cvit77b}.''

Calculation methods:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item
The analytic or ``string-inspired'' approach, based on the use of
worldline Green's functions: all path integrals are brought into Gaussian
form; this requires some expansion and truncation. They are then
calculated by Gaussian integration.
  \item
The semi-classical approximation, based on a stationary trajectory
(``worldline instanton'').
\end{enumerate}
We will focus on the closed-loop case in the following, since it turns out to
be simpler than the propagator one. Nevertheless, it should be emphasized
that everything that we will do in the following for the effective action can
also be done for the propagator.

Some reasonable gymnastics leads to the ``Bern-Kosower master

{\em Recursion and growth estimates in renormalizable quantum field theory}

Our method is very different in spirit from the constructive approach or the functional

expansion into primitive constituents, not unlike the decomposition of a $\zeta$ function
into Euler factors.

Our construction of a basis of primitives with a given Mellin
transform resolves overlapping divergences, thanks to the Hochschild cohomology of
the relevant Hopf algebras\rf{Kreimer99}.

We next assume there to be $p(k)$ primitives at $k$ loops where $p$ is a

{\em An {Abraham-Lorentz-}like equation for the electron from the
worldline variational approach to {QED}}:

They discuss the of a spin-1/2 electron dressed by an arbitrary number of
photons in the quenched approximation to QED. The approach is patterned
after Feynmanâ€™s celebrated variational treatment of the polaron
problem\rf{Feynman55}, which was first applied by Mano, Progr. Theor.
Phys. 14, 435 (1955) [8] to a relativistic  scalar  field  theory  and
rediscovered  and  expanded by them in a series of
papers\rf{rossch96a,rossch96b}. Its main features are the description of
relativistic particles by worldlines\rf{Schubert01} parametrized by the
proper time, an exact functional integration over the photons and a
variational approximation of the resulting effective action by a retarded
quadratic trial action. In recent work we have extended this approach to
more realistic theories, in particular to quenched QED\rf{AlRoSc00} (the
divergence structure and renormalization, a compact expression for the
anomalous mass dimension of the electron). Here they calculate the finite
contributions.

The variational formulation of worldline QED leads to an equation which
is similar to Abraham, Lorentz and Dirac description of the electron and
its self-interaction with the radiation field. The approach contains
(almost) all the ingredients of the relativistic field theory of
electrons and photons, in particular its divergence structure. This has
been demonstrated by deriving an approximate nonperturbative expression
for the anomalous mass dimension of the electron.

{\em Modern Functional Quantum Field Theory: Summing Feynman Graphs}:
a simple, analytic, functional approach to non-perturbative QFT, using a
functional representation of Fradkin to explicitly
calculate relevant portions of the Schwinger Generating Functional (GF).
In QED, this corresponds to

\emph{summing all Feynman graphs representing virtual photon exchange}

between charged particles. It is then possible to
see, analytically, the cancellation of an infinite number of
perturbative, UV logarithmic divergences, leading to an approximate but
most reasonable statement of finite charge renormalization. A similar
treatment of QCD, with the addition of a long-overlooked but simple
rearrangement of the Schwinger GF which displays Manifest Gauge
Invariance, is then able to produce a simple, analytic derivation of
quark-binding potentials without any approximation of infinite quark
masses. A crucial improvement of previous QCD theory takes into account
the experimental fact that asymptotic quarks are always found in bound
state.

\arXiv{hep-ph/9903357} (see \arXiv{hep-ph/9911437} and
\arXiv{hep-ph/0307057} for more detail) is motivated by applications to
Standard Model multi-particle diagrams, mostly at the tree level.

Perturbative calculations require an explicit breaking of gauge
invariance for technical reasons and the cancellation of unphysical
contributions is not manifest in intermediate stages of calculations. The
contribution of a particular Feynman diagram to a scattering amplitude
depends in the gauge fixing procedure and has no physical meaning.
the identification of partial sums of Feynman diagrams that are gauge
invariant by themselves is of great practical importance.
Calculation a subset of diagrams that is not gauge invariant has no
predictive power, because they depend on unphysical parameters introduced
during the gauge fixing.

A \emph{gauge invariance class} is a minimal subset of Feynman diagrams
that is independent of the gauge parameter and satisfies the
Slavnov-Taylor identities.

The set of diagrams connected by flavor and gauge flips they call
\emph{forest}, a set of diagrams connected by gauge flips the call
\emph{grove}. They shown that the groves are the minimal gauge invariance
classes of tree Feynman diagrams. In unbroken gauge theories, the
permutation symmetry of external gauge quantum numbers can be used to
subdivide the scattering amplitude corresponding to a grove further into
gauge invariant sub-amplitudes.

This (largely uncited) work seems to have no impact on the $(g-2)$
gauge sets discussed here.

Reuschle and Weinzierl\rf{ReuWei13} {\em Decomposition of one-loop {QCD}
amplitudes into primitive amplitudes based on shuffle relations}
cite our \refref{NPB81}. They say:

QCD calculations organise the computation of the one-loop amplitude as a sum
over smaller pieces, called \emph{primitive amplitudes}.
The most important features of a primitive amplitude are gauge invariance
and a fixed cyclic ordering of the external legs.
Primitive amplitudes should not be confused with \emph{partial amplitudes}
(also referred to as a \emph{dual amplitude} or a \emph{color-ordered amplitude}),
which are the kinematic coefficients of the independent colour
structures.
The first step in a discussion of perturbative Yang-Mills is the
decoupling of color from kinematics,
\beq
A_{tot} = \sum c_J A_J
\ee{KolShi14(1.1)}
where $A_{tot}$ represents the total amplitude for a scattering process,
$A_J $ are all the possible color structures,
and $A_J$ are partial amplitudes which depend only on the kinematical data
(momenta and polarizations).
Partial amplitudes are gauge invariant, but not
necessarily cyclic ordered.
Partial amplitudes are far simpler to calculate than the
full amplitude. There
exist linear relations among the partial amplitudes, called
Kleiss-Kuijf relations, which reduce the number of linearly
independent partial amplitudes to $(n-2)!$
The leading contributions in an $1/N$-expansion (with $N$ being the number of colours)
are usually cyclic ordered, the sub-leading parts are in general not.
The decomposition of the full one-loop amplitude into partial amplitudes is easily derived.
However, it is less trivial to find a decomposition of the partial
amplitudes into primitive amplitudes.

There are several possible choices for a basis in colour space.
A convenient choice is the colour-flow basis\rf{tHooft:1974jz}.

{\em Color structures and permutations} has a
useful overview of the literature in the introduction, and is a very
interesting read overall.

We may permute (or re-label) the external legs in the expression for a
color structure and thereby obtain another color structure. This means
that the space of color structures is a representation of $S_n$, the
group of permutations. A natural question is to characterize this
representation including its character and its decomposition into
irreducible representations (irreps).

The decomposition of color structures into irreps was suggested by
Zeppenfeld\rf{Zeppenfeld88}.

The space of tree-level color structures $TCS_n$ of dimension
\beq
\mbox{dim}(TCS_n) = (n-2)!
\ee{KolShi14(2.7)}
is the vector space
generated by all diagrams with $n$ external legs and an oriented cubic
vertex, which are connected and without loops (trees), where diagrams
which differ by the Jacobi identity are to be identified.

The $f$-based and $t$-based color structures are related by celebrated
Kleiss-Kuijf\rf{KleKui89} relations (rederived in this paper).

The original problem, that of capturing symmetries of the partial
amplitudes which originate with those of the color structures, is now
formulated as the problem of obtaining the $S_n$ character
of the space of color structures. It turns out that (at least at
tree level) this problem was fully solved in the mathematics literature
by Getzler and M. M. Kapranov\rf{GetKap98}.

The free Lie algebra over some set $A$, denoted by $L(A)$, is the Lie
algebra generated by $A$ with no further relations apart for antisymmetry
and the Jacobi identity which are mandated by definition.

{\em Color-flow decomposition of {QCD} amplitudes}

The \emph{color-flow} decomposition is based on treating the $SU(N)$
gluon field as an $N\!\times\!N$ matrix.
(PC: I think that is what I actually do.)
It has several nice features.
First, a similar decomposition exists for all multiparton amplitudes,
like the fundamental-representation decomposition. Second, the color-flow
decomposition allows for a very efficient calculation of multiparton
amplitudes. Third, it is a very natural way to decompose a QCD amplitude.
As the name suggests, it is based on the flow of color, so the
decomposition has a simple physical interpretation.

To calculate the amplitude, one orders the gluons clockwise, and draws
color-flow lines, with color flowing counterclockwise, connecting
adjacent gluons. One then deforms the color-flow lines in all possible
ways to form the Feynman diagrams that contribute to this partial
amplitude. The Feynman diagrams that contribute to a partial amplitude
are planar. This is not due to an expansion in $1/N$; the partial
amplitudes are exact. They note (see their Table 1) that the number of
Feynman diagrams contributing to an $n$-gluon partial amplitude grows as
$\approx 3 \cdot 8^n$. In contrast, the number of Feynman diagrams
contributing to the full amplitude grows factorially, as
$\approx (2n)!$.

Thanks for the listings of gauge sets, and of course, for your whole amazing
project. While in detail my 1977 guesses are wrong, the overall finiteness conjecture
still looks good - it's crazy how small all these individual contributions are.

The reason I got into a collaboration with Kinoshita (nominally, Tung-Mow
Yan was my adviser) is that he gave me the 3-loop ladder diagram (at
4-loops, it would belong to your gauge set (6) = $(4,0,0)$) to evaluate,
and I derived a compact formula for the parametric integrand of $n$-loops
ladder diagram. So maybe gauge sets of type (6) = $(4,0,0)$ are the
easiest to evaluate?

Is evaluating gauge set $(5,0,0)$ with 5 loops be feasible? If that turns out to be
+1/2, that would be sweet.

\item[2017-05-05 Laporta] to Predrag

To my knowledge, there are no ideas how to bound the sizes of the gauge sets.

In the set (6) = $(4,0,0)$ the ladder is easy to evaluate, but the others are not.
The evaluation of the set $(5,0,0)$ with five loops would be a real challenge.

Among the sets (1)-(6), the easiest to evaluate is the set (3) = $(1,2,1)$.

\item[2017-05-25 Predrag] to Stefano

I've now searched through the literature. There seem to be 2 approaches
that might be relevant to establishing bounds on, and actually
computation of gauge-invariant sets (I am ignoring various $N=2$ and
$N=4$ supersymmetric models), Hopf algebraic approach of Kreimer and
collaborators, and the worldline formalism pursued by Schubert and
collaborators. It operates with $N$-photon propagators, the ingredient
that defines the quenched gauge-invariant sets for $(g-2)$. The summary
of this literature is in \refsect{sect:future}.
