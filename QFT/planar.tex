{James M. Drummond} {\em Cluster algebras and scattering amplitudes},

post on Flickr.com. Analytic relations for scattering amplitudes
expressed the cluster algebras for planar $N=4$ super Yang-Mills theory
that generalize the Steinmann relations.  I still do not know what hit

Penington, Shenker, Stanford and Yang\rf{PSSY19}
{\em Replica wormholes and the black hole interior},
\arXiv{1911.11977}:
Their analysis is inspired by the ``free probability'' results discussed
in 2009 Speicher\rf{Speicher09}, {\em Free probability theory},
\arXiv{0911.0087} and \arXiv{1404.3393}, and e.g. figure 1 of the (Predrag's)
earlier\rf{PlanFieldThe}, from 1981.
Speicher explain the work of Voiculescu\rf{Voiculescu91}: ``Free probability theory was
created by Dan Voiculescu around 1985, motivated by his efforts to
understand special classes of von Neumann algebras.'' He writes about
Cvitanovi{\'c}, Lauwers and Scharbach\rf{NPB82} {\em The planar sector of
field theories}: ``This description of freeness in terms of free
cumulants is related to the planar approximations in random matrix theory.
In a sense some aspects of this theory of freeness were anticipated (but
mostly neglected) in the physics community in the \refref{NPB82} paper.''
Voiculescu does not seem to cite me.

Smith\rf{Smith92} {\em Planar version of {Baym-Kadanoff} theory}

Djordje Mini\'c, {\em Remarks on Large N Coherent States}
\arXiv{hep-th/9502117}: `` Recently it has become apparent that another
algebraic structure seems to be natural for the large N matrix models,
the so called free Fock space. This concept naturally appears within the
context of non-commutative probability theory, developed by Voiculescu
and collaborators\rf{Voiculescu91}, and it has been used in the physics
literature in the analysis of large N matrix models by Haan\rf{Haan80} and
Cvitanovi\'c and co-workers\rf{NPB82}, and more recently by
Douglas\rf{Douglas95} and Gopakumar and Gross\rf{GopGro95} {\em Mastering
the master field}. (Similar ideas have been exploited in the study of so
called infinite statistics by Greenberg\rf{Greenberg91}).
''

Haan writes `` In 1980 I used these operators to define ``planar fields''
for the non-interacting field theory\rf{Haan80}'' (received 16 June
1980), which puts him three months ahead of me\rf{PlanFieldThe} (received
21 October 1980).

Douglas\rf{Douglas95} {\em Stochastic master fields} writes: ``We treat
the stochastic equation for large N master fields proposed by Greensite
and Halpern using a construction of master fields modelled after work of
Voiculescu, and show that it contains the same information as the usual
factorized Schwinger-Dyson equations. We comment on the relation to
earlier work of \rf{Haan80} and of Cvitanovi\'c, Lauwers and
Scharbach\rf{NPB82}.

``The problem of the construction of the master field has been discussed in
many works [...] by using methods of non-commutative
probability theory. In \refref{AreVol96}
it was shown that the masterfields satisfy to standard equations of
relativistic field theory but fields are quantized according to a new
rule. These fields have a realization in the free (Boltzmannian)
Fock space.''

Ebrahimi-Fard and Patras\rf{EbrPat16}
{\em The combinatorics of {Green}'s functions in planar field theories}:
`` In the early 1980s, Cvitanovi\'c \etal\rf{PlanFieldThe,NPB82} proposed
a perturbative approach to quantum field theories in the planar setting.
This was largely motivated by a desire to properly encode the behavior of
the planar sector of quantum chromodynamics (QCD), based on 't Hooft's
seminal 1974 paper\rf{tHooft:1974jz}. An interesting feature of planar
field theories is the manner in which the calculus of symmetry factors
differs (and becomes simpler) compared to classical field theories.
Planarity is reflected in the strictly non-commutative nature of the
theory, which results in a rather substantial deviation from the
classical description of the relations between different types of Green's
functions. Cvitanovi\'c \etal\ observed that the functional relation
between the generating functionals of the full and connected planar
Green's functions is encoded by a fixed point type equation, which is
solved by the generating functionals. This fixed point equation replaces
the common exponential map that relates the generating functionals of the
full and connected Green's functions in classical theories (in this
article, classical will refer to non-planar field theories and their
associated objects, such as Green's functions, Feynman diagrams, and
amplitudes).

The exponential relation between classical generating functionals is
analogous to the moments-cumulants relation in classical probability
theory\rf{Speed83}. Singer realized the existence of a similar connection
between planar field theories and Voiculescu's theory of free
probability\rf{Voiculescu91}. It turns out that the description given by
Cvitanovi\'c \etal\  of the relations between planar Green's functions is
closely related to Speicher's combinatorial approach to the relations
between moments and cumulants in free probability\rf{Speicher09}.

The description of the relations between planar Green's functions
presented in these notes is based on our recent work on the algebraic and
combinatorial structures underlying the relations between moments and
cumulants in free and classical probability theory\rf{EbrPat15}
[...]
It turns out that in both cases the linear fixed point equation has a
proper exponential solution. In the classical case, this exponential
solution coincides with the standard exponential that relates classical
moments and cumulants. In the non-classical setting, the relation between
free cumulants and moments is also portrayed by an exponential, which is
defined with respect to a non-commutative shuffle product. The difference
between these two exponentials is analogous to the difference between
exponential solutions of scalar- and matrix-valued non-autonomous linear
differential equations. Here, we propose a similar approach to
the–Hopf–algebraic understanding of the relations between full and
connected Green’s functions in planar QFT.

[...] the polynomial expressions giving full Green's functions in terms
of connected ones constitute a multivariate generalization of the
classical Bell polynomials that relate, among others, moments and
cumulants in classical probability\rf{EbLuMa14}.

[...]  A precise description of the combinatorial nature of the recursive
structure that is on display here will be elaborated on below, in terms
of a double tensor Hopf algebra equipped with a non-cocommutative
unshuffle coproduct.

Thanks for the `Rutgers' talk today - fascinating!
Some comments to myself, feel free to ignore:

For me the simplest example of `over-determined' matrix system is the
Hamilton-Cayley equation satisfied by any $[n\times{n}]$ matrix (see
birdtracks.eu
\HREF{https://birdtracks.eu/version9.0/GroupTheory.pdf\#section.6.5}
{sect.~6.5 {\em Characteristic equation}}). In the free algebra basis of
cyclic words (traces of products of matrices) and their products, the problem
is `over-determined' in the sense that there are infinitely many equations,
one for each $p>n$ in my eq.~(6.48).

Your `over-determined' examples are much more sophisticated, I have no
suggestion as how to prove them.

For my papers that I think are related to your work, see
\HREF{https://cns.gatech.edu/~predrag/papers/preprints.html\#PlanFieldThe}
{Planar field theory} on my homepages.

Your loop equations look to me similar to my \refref{PlanFieldThe}
Dyson-Schwinger equations
\HREF{https://cns.gatech.edu/~predrag/papers/PlanFieldThe.pdf} {eq.~(19)},
and I think your Catalan numbers show up in eq.~(21).
(A longer version, our \refref{NPB82}, is
\HREF{https://cns.gatech.edu/~predrag/papers/NPB82.pdf} {here}).
Catalan number counting also shows up in my \refref{PCar}
\HREF{https://cns.gatech.edu/~predrag/papers/PCar.pdf} {eq.~(B2)},
see also eq.~(B5).

The Feynman graph counting in our \refref{CvLaPe78}, like
\HREF{https://cns.gatech.edu/~predrag/papers/PlanFieldThe.pdf} {eq~(3.14)},
could (maybe?) also be of interest.

Titouan Carette, Etienne Moutot, Thomas Perez and Renaud Vilmart
{\em Compositionality of planar perfect matchings},
\arXiv{2302.08767}:

Computing scalars of the planar W-calculus corresponds to counting perfect
matchings of planar graphs, and so can be carried in polynomial time using
the FKT algorithm, making the planar W-calculus an efficiently simulable
fragment of the ZW-calculus, in a similar way that the Clifford fragment is
for ZX-calculus.

The main idea behind the algorithm is that for planar graphs, it is possible
to find a good orientation of the edges (called a Pfaffian orientation) in
polynomial time such that the number of perfect matchings is the Pfaffian of
the adjacency matrix A (actually its skew-symmetric version, called Tutte
matrix) of the oriented graph. A result due to Cayley then shows that the
Pfaffian is the square root of the determinant of A.

In particular, all planar graphs are Pafaffian, says a very unhelpful
(\HREF{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pfaffian_orientation} {wiki}).

   \item[2023-03-02 Predrag]
Notes on `free probability'.

In 1980 I formulated {\em planar field theory}\rf{PlanFieldThe,NPB82};
the two published papers are
\HREF{https://cns.gatech.edu/~predrag/papers/preprints.html\#PlanFieldThe} {here}).
A bosonic field theory an $n$-point Green function is fully symmetric, so its
symmetry factor is $1/n!$.
In planar field theory sources $J$ do not commute (they are `free'), and an
$n$-point Green function is only cyclically symmetric, with symmetry factor
$1/n$ (as in Ruelle's dynamical zeta function, as periodic orbits
are generally only cyclically symmetric). I give the Dyson-Schwinger
equation, e.g. figure 1 of my
\refref{PlanFieldThe}.

Speicher explains the 1991  work of Voiculescu\rf{Voiculescu91}: ``Free probability theory was
created by Dan Voiculescu around 1985, motivated by his efforts to
understand special classes of von Neumann algebras.'' He writes about
Cvitanovi{\'c}, Lauwers and Scharbach\rf{NPB82} {\em The planar sector of

cumulants is related to the planar approximations in random matrix theory.
In a sense some aspects of this theory of freeness were anticipated (but
mostly neglected) in the physics community in the \refref{NPB82} paper.''
Voiculescu does not seem to cite us at all.

	\end{align}
\end{subequations}
differs from ChaosBook
\HREF{https://chaosbook.org/chapters/ChaosBook.pdf\#equation.T.1.10}{(A20.6)}.
That is because their formula is for \emph{free} cumulants.

For comparisonm here is the relevant clipping from ChaosBook Appendix A20:

    \begin{quote}
Moments can be collected into the (exponential) moment-generating function
\index{moment!-generating function}
\index{generating!function, exponential}
\index{exponential!generating function}
\beq
\expct{e^{\beta\obser}}
    = 1 + \sum_{k=1}^\infty \frac{\beta^k}{k!}\expct{\obser^k}
\,.
\ee{MomGenFct}
Why the prefactor $1/k!$ (a Taylor series), and not $1/k$ (a logarithmic
series), or $1$ (discrete Laplace transform or $Z$-transform)?
In statistical,
stochastic and quantum mechanics / quantum field theory applications one
is solving linear ODEs or PDEs, and their solutions are always
exponential in form.

Hardly any experiment measures $\obser^k$ for $k>2$
and raising approximate numbers to high powers is not smart:
if $|\obser| <1$, $\obser^k$ gets very small very fast, and conversely if
$|\obser| >1$, $\obser^k$ gets very big. Still, with a bit of hindsight,
one finds that moments do play a natural,
fundamental role if folded into
the \emph{cumulant-generating function}
\index{cumulant} \index{cumulant!generating function}
\beq
\ln \expct{e^{\beta\obser}}
  = \sum_{k=1}^\infty \frac{\beta^k}{k!}\expct{\obser^k}_c
\,,
\ee{MomGenFct1}
where the subscript $c$ indicates a \emph{cumulant}, or, in statistical
mechanics and quantum field theory contexts, the `connected Green's
function'. Were $\expct{\obser^k}=\expct{\obser}^k$, we would have only
one term in the series \refeq{MomGenFct1},
\(
\ln \expct{e^{\beta\obser}}
  = \ln e^{\beta\expct{\obser}}
  = \beta\expct{\obser}
\,,
\)
and that would be that. So cumulants $\expct{\obser^k}_c$ measure
fluctuations about the mean $\expct{\obser}$. Indeed, expanding the
logarithm of the series \refeq{MomGenFct}, it is easy to check that the
first cumulant is the {mean}, the second is the {variance},
\beq
\expct{\obser^2}_c
   = \expct{(\obser-\expct{\obser})^2}
   = \expct{{\obser}^2} - \expct{\obser}^2
   = \sigma^2
\,,
\ee{variance}
and $\expct{\obser^3}_c$ is the third central moment, or the
\emph{skewness},
\index{skewness}
\beq
\expct{\obser^3}_c
   = \expct{(\obser-\expct{\obser})^3}
   = \expct{{\obser}^3}
    -3 \expct{\obser^2} \expct{\obser}
    +2 \expct{\obser}^3
\,.
\ee{skewness}
% The higher cumulants, however, are \emph{not} central moments.
The fourth cumulant,
\bea
\expct{\obser^4}_c
  &=& \expct{(\obser-\expct{\obser})^4}
      -3 \expct{(\obser-\expct{\obser})^2}^2
  \continue
  &=& \expct{{\obser}^4}
     -4 \expct{\obser^3} \expct{\obser}
     -3 \expct{{\obser}^2}^2
   +12 \expct{\obser^2} \expct{\obser}^2
    -6 \expct{\obser}^4
\label{4thCumulant}
\,,
\eea
rewritten in terms of standardized moments, is known as the
\emph{kurtosis}:
\index{kurtosis}
\beq
\frac{1}{\sigma^4}\expct{\obser^4}_c
  = \frac{1}{\sigma^4}\expct{(\obser-\expct{\obser})^4} -3
\,.
\ee{kurtosis}

The reason why cumulants are preferable to moments is that
for a normalized Gaussian distribution all cumulants beyond the
second one vanish, so they are a measure of deviation of statistics
from Gaussian.
For a `free' or `Gaussian' field theory the only non-vanishing cumulant
is the second one; for field theories with interactions the derivatives
of
\(
\ln \expct{\exp(\beta\obser)}
\)
 with respect to $\beta$ then yield cumulants, or the
Burnett coefficients, % \refeq{trans-k},
or `effective' $n$-point Green's functions or $n$-point correlations.

Speicher {\em Free probability (FP) theory and non-crossing partitions},
S{\'e}minaire Lotharingien de Combinatoire
\HREF{https://www.emis.de/journals/SLC/wpapers/s39speicher.pdf}
     {{\bf 39}, B39c} (1997),
built upon fundamental work of Rota.

Mingo and Speicher\rf{MinSpe17}
{\em Free Probability and Random Matrices} (2017).

In general, the $n$-th moment is a polynomial in the cumulants $c_1, \cdots ,
c_n$, but it is very hard to write down a concrete formula for this.
Nevertheless there is a very nice way to understand the combinatorics
behind this connection, and this is given by the concept of multiplicative
functions on the lattice of all partitions.

Introduces zeta function and its inverse, M{\"o}bius function. Has nice
graphical illustration of 4th cumulant on p.~14; FP is related to my planar
field theory in which external legs cannot be crossed (but my traces have
cyclic symmetry).
