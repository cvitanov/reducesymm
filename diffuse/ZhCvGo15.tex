\section{Introduction}

    \TZ{2015-10-17}{
this is an example what an editing comment by myself would look like
   }

The advances in the theory of dynamical systems have brought a new life to
Boltzmann's mechanical formulation of statistical mechanics. Sinai, Ruelle and
Bowen (SRB) have generalized Boltzmann's notion of ergodicity for a constant
energy surface for a Hamiltonian system in equilibrium to dissipative systems in
{nonequilibrium} stationary states. In this more general setting the attractor
plays the role of a constant energy surface, and the SRB measure x is a
generalization of the Liouville measure. Such measures are purely microscopic
and indifferent to whether the system is at equilibrium, close to equilibrium or
far from it. ``Far for equilibrium'' in this context refers to systems with
large deviations from Maxwell's equilibrium velocity distribution. Furthermore,
the theory of dynamical systems has yielded new sets of microscopic dynamics
formulas for macroscopic observables such as diffusion constants, to which we
turn now.

Chaotic motions exist in many systems. There are physical problems such as beam
defocusing in particle accelerators (ref?) or chaotic behavior of passive
tracers in $2$\dmn\ rotating flows\rf{solomon1994chaotic} which can be described
as deterministic diffusion in periodic arrays. In biological field, many
important dynamical processes (often at cellular level) are described in terms
of diffusion coefficients. Such examples include the transport of ions across
the cell membranes\rf{stein2012transport} and the movement of microorganism
(e.g. bacterials) through natural ecosystems\rf{koch1990diffusion}. In this
paper we will discuss the transport property of more "macroscopic" systems (such
as moving robots\rf{saranli2001rhex}) where a ``diffusive description'' also
applies.

Lately, there has been an increased focus on robot locomotion in complex
environments (check Science and ROPP reference, the systematic study of
interactions between environment and locomotion, which we now call
``robophysics''). Many of those studies use substrates that are spatially
homogeneous and we have a good
understanding\rf{li2009sensitive,li2013terradynamics}. However, little is known
for locomotion in heterogeneous environment. There are some limited
experimental/theoretical studies for relatively simple settings (e.g. slopes,
ref). In this paper we intend to approach the longterm transport properties of
locomotion in a more complex environment, i.e. in a field of scatterers of which
the scales are comparable to the locomotor. The potential applications of this
study include mars navigation and hazardous rescue.

As a gedanken experiment, suppose a passively controlled robot is moving in a
boulder field at constant speed. The diffusion coefficient, which describes
roughly how much area the robot explored in a unit time, is the key quantity we
would like to investigate. We place the boulder in a regular, periodic array and
assume that we are in the heavy boulder limit such that after each collision
event, only the robot is deflected and boulders remain immobilized. With these
presumptions we effectively created a periodic Lorentz gas model\rf{Dettm14} for
locomotion in a boulder field.

In the paper we apply cycle expansions to the analysis of {\em diffusion}
properties of the system. The resulting formulas are exact; no probabilistic
assumptions are made, and the all correlations are taken into account by the
inclusion of cycles of all periods. The infinite extent systems for which the
periodic orbit theory yields formulas for diffusion and other transport
coefficients are spatially periodic, the global {\statesp} being tiled with
copies of a elementary cell.

In \refsect{s-DiffPerArr} we briefly review the formulas for diffusion
coefficients in the $2$\dmn\ periodic Lorentz gas, using dynamics restricted in
elementary cell. In\refsect{s-SymmetryReduction} we consider further the
rotational symmetry of the lattice and derive the diffusion coefficients using
fundamental domain cycles. Because we will work with different kinds of \statesp
s, through out the text we will repeatedly using tildes ($\tilde{\quad}$),
nothings and hats ($\hat{\quad}$) atop symbols to signify the dynamical
quantities in fundamental domain, elementary cell and full state space,
respectively.

\end{figure}


The $2$\dmn\ Lorentz gas is an infinite scatterer array in which diffusion of a
light molecule in a gas of heavy scatterers is modeled by the motion of a point
particle in a plane bouncing off an array of reflecting disks. The Lorentz gas
is called ``gas'' as one can equivalently think of it as consisting of any
number of point-like fast ``light molecules'' interacting only with the
stationary ``heavy molecules'' and not among themselves.  As the scatterer array
is built up from only defocusing concave surfaces, it is a pure hyperbolic
system, and one of the simplest nontrivial dynamical systems that exhibits
deterministic diffusion, \reffig{fig-chaoticBouncing}.

% The original Lorentz gas assumed a random distribution of heavy
% scatterers; in this case a probabilistic description is unavoidable.

\subsection{Periodic orbit theory}

    \PC{2015-10-17}{cite \wwwcb{}\rf{DasBuch}}

In \refrefs{art91,LorentzDiff,CGS92,Artuso94} it was shown that deterministic
diffusion tensor in the {\em periodic} Lorentz gas is can be expressed in terms
of (relative) \po s, and exact \cycForm\ for such global dynamical averages as
Lyapunov exponent and diffusion tensor were derived, using only the dynamics in
the elementary cell. For any dynamical system that has translational symmetry,
the full state space $\hM$ (i.e., both spatial coordinates and momenta) has a
periodic tiling \[\hM=\bigcup_{ \hn \in T} \pS_{\hn},\] by {\em translating}
$\pS_{\hn}$ of an {\em elementary cell} $\pS$, with $T$ the abelian group of
lattice translations.

In the context of Lorentz gas system, the elementary cell is the hexagonal
region centered at the scatterer, see \reffig{fig-schrieberFig1}. The dynamics
restricted inside the elementary cell is understood as the periodic boundary
condition: when the particle leaves the edge of the hexagon cell, it immediately
enters the region again from the opposite edge. We distinguish two types of
diffusive behavior; the {\em infinite horizon} case, which allows for infinite
length flights, and the {\em finite horizon} case, where any free particle
trajectory must hit a disk in finite time. The transition between horizon and
infinite horizon is controlled by the ratio of $w/r$, where $w$ is the gap
between nearest pair of disk and $r$ the radius of the disk.

We shall now relate the dynamics in $\pS$ to diffusive properties of the Lorentz
gas in $\hM$. Let $\hx(t)\,=\,\hflow{t}{\hx_0}$ denotes the point in the global
space $\hM$ reached by the flow in time $t$. $x(t)\,=\,\flow{t}{\xInit}$ denotes
the corresponding flow in the elementary cell; the two are related by

\beq
\hn_t(\xInit)=\hflow{t}{\xInit} - \flow{t}{\xInit} \in T \,,
\ee{l-diff-hatn}

the translation of the endpoint of the global path into the elementary
cell $\pS$.

Fix a vector $\beta \in \reals^d$, where $d$ is the dimension of the
{\statesp}. We will compute the diffusive properties of the Lorentz
gas from the leading eigenvalue of the Rulle-Frobenius-Perron \evOper\
\beq
\eigenvL(\beta)\,=\, \lim_{t \rightarrow \infty} \frac{1}{t} \log \langle
e^{\beta \cdot (\hx(t) -x) } \rangle_\pS ~, \quad
\label{eq-diff-1}
\eeq
where the average is over all initial points in the elementary cell, $x \in
\pS$. If all odd derivatives vanish by symmetry, there is no drift and the
second derivatives
\begin{widetext}
\[
2d D_{ij} = \left . {\frac{\partial}{\partial \beta_i}} {\frac{\partial} 
{\partial \beta_j}} \eigenvL(\beta)\right\vert_{\beta=0} \,=\,\lim_{t\rightarrow
\infty} {\frac{1}{t}} \langle {(\hx(t) -x)_i (\hx(t) -x)_j } \rangle_\pS ~,
\]
\end{widetext}
yield a diffusion matrix.  This symmetric matrix can, in general, be anisotropic
(\ie, have $d$ distinct eigenvalues and eigen\-vectors). The spatial diffusion
constant is then given by the Einstein relation
\[
D\,=\,{1\over 2 d} \sum_i \left .{{\partial}^2 \over {\partial
      \beta^2_i}} \eigenvL(\beta)\right |_{\beta=0} \,=\,
\lim_{t\rightarrow \infty} {1\over{2d t}} \langle {(\hat{q}(t) -q)^2 }
\rangle_\pS~ ~,
\]
where the $i$ sum is restricted to the spatial components $q_i$ of the
{\statesp} vectors $x=(q,p)$, \ie, if the dynamics is Hamiltonian, the sum is
over the $d$ degrees of freedom.

% PC{reinstate mass, velocity, size to get $\beta$, $m$, $\sigma
% dependencies right}

We now turn to the connection between diffusion and periodic orbits in
the elementary cell. It was shown in \refref{CGS92} that the ensemble average in
\refeq{eq-diff-1} can be written as an integral over the elementary cell
\beq
\langle e^{\beta\cdot(\hx(t)-x)} \rangle
   = \frac{1}{\vert \pS \vert}\int_{x,y\in \pS} dxdy {\cal L}^t(y,x),
\eeq
given the linear \evOper operator
\beq
{\cal L}^t(y,x) = e^{\beta\cdot(\hx(t)-x)}\delta(y-x(t))
\label{eq-eOper}
\eeq
The interesting dynamical averages is determined by the spectrum of the operator
\beq \det(\eigenvL - \Lop) \,=\,\prod_{p} \exp \left(
  - { \sum_{r=1}^\infty {1 \over r} { e^{(\beta \cdot \hn_p- s
        \period{p}) r} \over \oneMinJ{r} }
  } \right) \,,
\ee{lor-diff-14}
or the corresponding \dzeta\
\beq
1/\zeta(\beta, s)\,=\,\prod_{p}\left( 1 - \frac{e^{(\beta \cdot \hn_p-
      s \period{p})}}{|\ExpaEig_p|} \right) ~.
\label{zeta-diff}
\eeq

The \dzeta\ \cycForm\ for the diffusion constant, zero mean drift
$ \expct{ \hat{x}_i } = 0 \,, $ is given by
 \beq D \,=\,{1 \over 2 d}
{ \expct{\hat{x}^2}_\zeta \over \expct{\period{}}_\zeta } \,=\,{1
  \over 2 d } \, {1 \over \expct{\period{}}_\zeta} \sumprime
\frac{(-1)^{k+1} (\hn_{p_1}+ \cdots+ \hn_{p_k})^2}
{|\ExpaEig_{p_1}\cdots \ExpaEig_{p_k}|} \, ,
\label{eq-ecDiffCoef}
\eeq
where the sum is over all distinct non-repeating combination of prime cycles (in
the elementary cell). The derivation is standard, still the formula is strange.
Diffusion is unbounded motion across an infinite lattice; nevertheless, the
reduction to the elementary cell enables us to compute relevant quantities in
the usual way, in terms of periodic orbits.

\subsection{Cycles in elementary cell}
\begin{figure}

  \caption{ Elementary cell symbolic dynamics is obtained by labeling the
  translation vectors connecting the center of the current disk to the center of
  the next disk. (a) The finite horizon is here imposed by limiting jumps from
  the center cell to only the short jumps (six even labels $0, 2,\cdots,10$) and
  the `long jumps' (six odd labels $1, 3,\cdots,11$). (b) Running mode
  \cycle{05} advances by $\hn_4$ per period. (c) In the elementary cell this is
  a \po\ \cycle{05} of topological length 2.  }
  \label{fig-diskDirectionsElCell}
\end{figure}

We use the symbolic dynamics developed in \refref{CGS92} and briefly review the
concepts here. With imposed finite horizon there are 12 possible ways of jump
from a disk (\reffig{fig-diskDirectionsElCell}\,(a)). Any trajectory in the 
full space can always be constructed from a series of flights, each belongs to  
the 12 ``signature jumps''. In particular, a periodic orbit in the elementary 
cell is represented as a repeatable string of such symbols. For example, the 
bouncing mode between nearest disks is written as \cycle{06}, meaning that 
the periodic orbit is consisted of two successive flights, one traveling 
towards right (symbol $0$) and the next reflecting backwards (symbol $6$). 

Periodic orbits in elementary cell can either be stationary in the full space
and goes back to its original place after completing a full cycle (e.g.,
\cycle{06}); or can be in a running mode that generates a net displacement along
the trajectory (e.g., \cycle{05}, \reffig{fig-diskDirectionsElCell}\,b and c).
The stationary cycles ``trap'' the  particle locally for a finite amount of time
while the running cycles advance it. The final diffusion \refeq{eq-ecDiffCoef}
is conceptually the result of competition between the two modes.

With the symbolic dynamics, we use the least action principle to compute the 
cycles~\rf{DasBuch}. In a planetary Hamiltonian billiard system, the 
Maupertuis' principle indicates that the traveling length along a cycle is 
minimized. In numerical schemes, it turns into a problem of optimizing the 
total link length for the specific sequence of disks visited along the orbit.

When the scattering array has further discrete symmetries, such as reflection
symmetry, each elementary cell may be built from a {\em fundamental domain}
${\widetilde \pS}$ by the action of a discrete (not necessarily abelian) group
$G$. The quantity $\tx(t)\,=\,\tflow{t}{\tx}$ denotes the flow in the
fundamental domain ${\widetilde \pS}$; $\tflow{t}{\tx}$ is related to
$\flow{}{\tx}$ by a discrete symmetry $g \in G$ which maps $\tx(t)\in
{\widetilde \pS}$ to ${x}(t) \in {\pS}$. The full $\hM \rightarrow {\widetilde
\pS}$ reduction is complicated by the non-abelian nature of $G$, and will be
illustrated in this section in detail.

\subsection{How point group changes translation}


In fundamental domain, one has to realize a few facts before proceeding to the
cycle expansion derivation. A point $x$ in the elementary cell can be uniquely
identified by its ``mirror image'' in the fundamental domain:
\[
x=g\circ\tx,
\]
given a group action $g\in G$ the discrete symmetry group. In the triangular
periodic Lorentz gas the underlying point group is $C_{6v}$ (isomorphic to
$D_6$), and the hexagonal elementary cell is partitioned into 12 identical
triangular domains. We have to appreciate that the flow $\hat{\phi}^t$ is
G-equivariant under the lattice group symmetry, and proceed with the argument
that the displacement in full space is also equivariant under the point group
symmetry (which is a subset of the lattice group):
\beq
\hn_t(x)\equiv\hn_t(g\circ\tx)= g\circ\hn_t(\tx).
\eeq

We can apply this fact to the displacement associated with a prime periodic
orbit $\tp$ restricted in the fundamental domain. Let
$\tp\equiv\{\tx_0,\tx_1,\ldots,\tx_{N_\tp}\}$, with topological length $N_\tp$
and $\tx_i$ the bouncing points on the orbit. For each flight (e.g. from $\tx_i$
to $\tx_{i+1}$) we denote the associated displacement in full space $\hn(\tx_i,
e)$. However, one has to be careful when adding the individual displacements
together when moving along a fundamental domain orbit. Unlike in elementary
cell, the fundamental domain point $\tx_i$ does not distinguish in which
triangular piece it is. Instead, we assign a point group element
$g_\tp(\tx_{i+1},\tx_{i})$ to keep track of changes in absolute orientation. We
may now write the displacement traveled along the orbit, after finishing a full
cycle:
\[
\hn_{\tp}(\tx_{0})=\sum_{i=0}^{N_\tp-1}\hn(\tx_{i},g_{\tp,\tx_0}(\tx_{i}))=\sum_{i=0}^{N_\tp-1}g_{\tp,\tx_{0}}(\tx_{i})\circ\hn(\tx_{i},e),
\]
where $g_{\tp,\tx_{0}}(\tx_i)=\prod_0^{j-1} g_\tp(\tx_{j+1},\tx_{j})$ is the
accumulated orientation changes along the orbit when starting from $\tx_{0}$.
The displacement now has its dependence on the starting point we choose. We
denote the total group action for the orbit
\begin{widetext}
\[h_{\tp}(\tx_i)\equiv g_\tp(\tx_{i},\tx_{i-1})\circ\ldots\circ
g_\tp(\tx_{0},\tx_{N_\tp-1})\circ
g_\tp(\tx_{N_\tp-1},\tx_{N_\tp-2})\circ \ldots\circ
g_\tp(\tx_{i+1},\tx_{i}),\]
\end{widetext}
which one can immediately see the connection
$\flow{t_\tp}{\tx_i}=h_{\tp}(\tx_i)\tflow{t_\tp}{\tx_i}$. Although the group
action $h_{\tp}(\tx_i)$ depends on the initial points on the orbit, it is a
property of the orbit's symmetry, and subsequently all $h_{\tp}(\tx_i), \tx_i\in
\tp$ belong to the \emph{same} subgroup of $G$.

We also want to define the quantity:
\beq
\hat{L}_{\tp}^{r}(\tx_i)\equiv
(e+\hp^{1}(\tx_i)+\cdots+\hp^{r-1}(\tx_i))\cdot\hn_{\tp}(\tx_i),
\label{eq-fdDisplacement}
\eeq
to be the displacement traveled along the orbit $r$ times, starting from $\tx_i$.  Though one may not appreciate immediately, \refeq{eq-fdDisplacement} takes care of the rotational symmetry that does not commute with translation, and we will show that it gives the proper displacement needed for computing diffusion coefficient in fundamental domain.


\subsection{Gymnastics of equations}

We properly treat the discrete symmetry by projecting the trace of
\evOper \refeq{eq-eOper} to the group's subspace:
 \bea
\tr{\cal L}^t &=& \sum_{\alpha \in\II_G} \tr{\cal L}_{\alpha}^t\nonumber\\
\tr{\cal L}_{\alpha}^{t} &=& \frac{d_\alpha}{|G|}\sum_{\sigma \in
  G}\sum_{h\in G}\chi_\alpha(h)\int_{\t {\cal M}} d\tx \delta (h\tx -
\flow{t}{\tx})e^{\beta\cdot\sigma\cdot\hn^t(\tx)}.\nonumber\\
\label{eq-traceSum}
\eea

The delta function part $\delta (h\tx - \flow{t}{\tx})$ in the integral selects
the fundamental domain periodic points that satisfy the group condition $h\equiv
h^r_{\tp}(\tx_i)$. The displacement traveled starting from each of those points
and along the orbit $r$ times takes the form already computed in
\refeq{eq-fdDisplacement}. The rest is straight forward gymnastics of algebra,
which yields the dynamical zeta function for the $\alpha$ irreducible
representation:
\begin{widetext}
 \beq
\frac{1}{\zeta_{\alpha}(\beta,s,z)}
=\exp\left(-\frac{d_\alpha}{|G|}\sum_{\sigma\in G}\sum_{\tp}\frac{1}{N_{\tp}}\sum_{\tx_{i}\in\tp}\sum_{r=1}^{\infty}\frac{t_{\tp}^{r}}{r}\chi_{\alpha}(\hp^{r}(\tx_i))e^{\beta\cdot\sigma\cdot\hat{L}_{\tp}(r,\tx_i)}\right),
\label{eq-fdZeta}
\eeq
\end{widetext}

where
 \beq t_{\tp}\equiv
\frac{z^{N_{\tp}}e^{-sT_{\tp}}}{|\ExpaEig_\tp|}, \eeq

is the ``weight'' associated to the orbit. Equation \refeq{eq-fdZeta} differs
from its counterpart in elementary cell, but can be reduced to if the symmetry
group contains only $e$.

We are interested in the one dimensional, symmetric trivial representation with
$ d_\alpha = 1 $ and all $ \chi(h) = 1 $; there by we drop the subscript $
\alpha $ in the following calculation. Partial derivative with respect to
$\beta$ gives:
\begin{widetext}
\bea
\frac{\partial^{2}}{\partial\beta^{2}}\frac{1}{\zeta(\beta,s,z)}
&=\frac{1}{\zeta(\beta,s,z)}\left(\left(\frac{1}{|G|} \sum_{\sigma\in G}\sum_{\tp}\sum_{\tx_i\in \tp}\sum_{r=1}^{\infty}\frac{\sigma\cdot \hat{L}_{\tp}^{r}(\tx_i)t_{\tp}^r e^{\beta\cdot\sigma\cdot \hat{L}_{\tp}^{r}(\tx_i)}}{N_{\tp}r}\right)^{2}\right.\nonumber\\
&\left.-\frac{1}{|G|}\sum_{\sigma\in G}\left(\sum_{\tp}\sum_{\tx_i\in
      \tp}\sum_{r=1}^{\infty}\frac{\vert \sigma\cdot
      \hat{L}_{\tp}^{r}(\tx_i)\vert^{2}t_{\tp}^{r}e^{\beta\cdot\sigma\cdot
        \hat{L}_{\tp}^{r}(\tx_i)}}{N_{\tp}r}\right)\right).
        \eea
\end{widetext}
The first term in the formula corresponds to $ \langle\hx\rangle^2 $ and
second to $ \langle\hx^2\rangle $. It is trivial to see that
\[\sum_{\sigma\in G}\frac{\sigma\cdot
  \hat{L}_{\tp}^r(\tx_i)t_{\tp}^r e^{\beta\cdot\sigma\cdot
  \hat{L}_{\tp}(r,\tx_i)}}{N_{\tp}r} \equiv 0
\]
due to the summation over the discrete group $G$. Thus the calculated mean drift
is zero, consistent with the symmetry of the system. Observing that the length
$\vert \sigma\cdot \hat{L}_{\tp}^{r}(\tx_i) \vert$ does not change under
rotation, we write
\bea
\langle\hx^2\rangle &=& \left.\frac{1}{\zeta(\beta,s,z)}\sum_{\tp}\sum_{r=1}^{\infty}\frac{t_{\tp}^{r}}{r}\sum_{\tx_i\in \tp}\frac{\vert\hat{L}_{\tp}^{r}(\tx_i)\vert^{2}}{N_{\tp}}\right\vert_{\beta=0,s=0, z=1} \nonumber\\
&=& \left.\prod_{\tp}\left(1-\frac{z^{N_{\tp}}}{\vert\ExpaEig_\tp\vert
    }\right)\sum_{\tp}\sum_{r=1}^{\infty}\left(\frac{z^{N_{\tp}}}{\vert\ExpaEig_\tp\vert
    }\right)^r\frac{\vert\hat{L}_{\tp}^{r}\vert^2}{r}\right\vert_{z=1}
\label{eq-meanSquareDisp}
\eea with $\hat{L}_{\tp}^{r}\equiv\sum_{\tx_i\in
  \tp}\frac{\vert\hat{L}_{\tp}^{r}(\tx_i)\vert^{2}}{N_{\tp}}$ the
average square displacement in full space when traveling along a fundamental
domain $r$ times. Formula \refeq{eq-meanSquareDisp} is an infinite polynomial in
the auxiliary variable $z$, and should be truncated to the topological length of
the longest periodic orbits find in calculation.

  \caption{\label{fig-fdflights} Fundamental domain symbolic dynamics. (a) With
  imposed finite horizon and starting on the edge of a disk in fundamental
  domain (the green filled region), there are at most 6 disks can be reached
  without collision (disk
  $\overline{0},\overline{1},\overline{2},\overline{4},\overline{10}$ and
  $\overline{11}$). Similar to how elementary cell symbolic dynamics are
  created, we label the 12 triangular pieces of a disk in a counter clock-wise
  manner, from $\underline{0}$ to $\underline{11}$. The combination of a disk
  label and a triangular piece label $\{\overline{i},\underline{j}\}$ uniquely
  identifies a free flight. (b) The fundamental domain fixed point
  $\{\overline{2},\underline{10}\}$, which corresponds to a periodic orbit of
  length 6 in elementary cell ($\cycle{0246810}$), is unwrapped in global space.
  After each collision we re-label the disks and triangular partitions according
  their relative positions to the ``new'' fundamental domain. In the figure the
  labels are also rotated according to the point group actions.}

  plane by a fundamental domain: two generators of \Dn{12} tiling, reflection
  $s$ across the short disk-disk separation, reflection $\ell$ across the long
  disk-disk separation; and a translation generator $f$ that pivots (`flips') a
  disk center to disk center by flip across the symmetry line normal to the
  short disk-disk separation. (5) Tiling of the 7-disk by copies of the
  fundamental domain, labeled by a (not unique) sequence of the three generators
  $\{s,\ell,f\}$, chosen so that each sequence contain one and only on
  disk-to-disk pivot $f$. }

The discussion is here. Compared with various methods, the symmetry reduced
cycle expansion method converges the fastest.
