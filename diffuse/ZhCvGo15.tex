  (`flips') a  disk center to disk center by flip across the symmetry
  line normal to the short disk-disk separation.

    {I do not really use the three generators to compute the fundamental
    domain cycles, instead I use the idea of topological distinct flights
    (\reffig{fig-fdflights}). We have yet to discuss the equivalence
    between the 3-generators and topological distinct flight in the two
    figures. }

  \caption{\label{fig-fdflights}
  Fundamental domain symbolic dynamics.
  (a) With  imposed finite horizon and starting on the edge of a disk in
  fundamental  domain (the green filled region), there are at most 6
  disks can be reached  without collision (disk
  $\overline{0},\overline{1},\overline{2},\overline{4},\overline{10}$ and
  $\overline{11}$). Similar to how elementary cell symbolic dynamics are
  created, we label the 12 triangular pieces of a disk in a counter
  clock-wise  manner, from $\underline{0}$ to $\underline{11}$. The
  combination of a disk  label and a triangular piece label
  $\{\overline{i},\underline{j}\}$ uniquely  identifies a topologically
  distinct flight.
  (b) The fundamental domain fixed point
  $\{\overline{2},\underline{10}\}$, which corresponds to a periodic
  orbit of length 6 in elementary cell ($\cycle{0246810}$), is unwrapped
  in   global space. After each collision we re-label the disks and
  triangular   partitions according to their relative positions to the
  ``new'' fundamental   domain. In the figure labels are also rotated
  according to the point   group actions.

In the international crystallographic notation, the hexagonal lattice is
called $p6mm$, with point group $6mm$, where prefix $p$ indicates that
the unit cell is primitive (not centered),
\beq
\Group = \{
e, C_6^+, C_6^-, C_3^+, C_3^-, C_2,
\sigma_{d1}, \sigma_{d2}, \sigma_{d3},
\sigma_{v1},\sigma_{v2}, \sigma_{v3}
\}
\,,
\eeq
with $s=\sigma_{d}$ the reflection across the short disk-disk separation,
and $\ell=\sigma_{v}$ reflection across the long disk-disk separation
generators of \Dn{12}. The entire space group $p6mm$ is then generated by
adding a disk-to-disk generator $f$ that pivots a disk center to another
by flip across the symmetry line normal to the short disk-disk
separation, \reffig{fig-7diskFundDflips}a. We find it convenient to
define $C$ as the generator of cyclic rotations by $\pi/3$,
\beq
\ell s = C_6^- = C
\,,\quad
C^6 = e
\,;\qquad
s \ell =  C_6^+
\,,\qquad
s  =  C_6^+ \ell
\,.
\eeq
    \TZ{2015-10-22}
    {The idea is that the topological periodic orbit in the fundamental
    domain is not sensitive to the order of flips. When $w$ increases,
    one might notice that a single flight along the orbit changes from
    $sf$ to $fs$. However, the relative position between the start and
    end triangular cells are always the same.}
A free flight between two disks in the full space may then be wrapped
into fundamental domain, according to the sequence cell edges
$\{s,\ell,f\}$ it passed. For example, there are different paths when
jump to disk $0$: it can be as simple as a single pivot about $f$, or can
be more complex such like $\ell f s$ that involves multiple flips,
~\reffig{fig-7diskFundDflips} b. Although we can associate each free
flight with a chain of the generators, some of the combinations are
equivalent. The short jump $sf$ is topologically equivalent to $fs$, in
the sense that the particle ends up in the same copy of fundamental
domain before next collision.

Our task is to generate all distinct itineraries from $\{s,\ell,f\}$. One
can immediately realize a partial list of the equivalence relations:
\bea
f s &=& s f
\,,\nonumber\\
f \ell f&=&\ell f \ell
\,.
\eea
All longer equivalence relations in ~\reffig{fig-7diskFundDflips} can be
reduced to the above primitive ones:
\bea
f s \ell &=& s f \ell\,,\nonumber\\
\ell f\ell s &=& f \ell s f\,.
\eea

There are also some pruning rules to keep in mind. Because a free flight
cannot cross the same border twice, sequences including $\ell\ell,ff,ss$
are forbidden. $C^3$ (and all higher orders) is also pruned as the
particle cannot cross the center hard disk; nor swirl around it.

While the string description of flight is mathematically rigorous and
accurate, it is practically hard to be encoded into programs for
computing the orbits, because the number of equivalent strings increases
exponentially when the length (of a single string) increases. However,
there is a more physically intuitive way to organize the type of flight,
by means of ``topological flight'', \reffig{fig-fdflights} (a). In this
representation, a equivalence relation like $sf\equiv fs$ can be uniquely
identified by a combination of a disk number and a partition number
$\{\overline{0},\underline{6}\}$. Longer flight such like $\ell f \ell s
\ell f \equiv  f \ell f s \ell f \equiv f \ell s f \ell f \equiv f \ell s
\ell f \ell$ that cross many boundaries now yields a very simple symbol
pair $\{\overline{1},\underline{5}\}$.

The topological flight leads to a straight forward numerical scheme to
find cycles. The disk number fixes the two ends of the free flight while
the partition number limits the range of angles on the disk. Similar to
searching cycles in elementary cell, we now have a constrained version of
numerical minimization problem which can be solved using standard
non-linear optimization approach.

    {I have not yet talked about the pruning rule in detail here; it is
    more complicated bases on the reflection angle}

\end{figure}

       \TZ{2015-10-19}{Any comment on caption of \reffig{fig-convergence}?}
Compared with various methods, the symmetry reduced cycle expansion
method converges the fastest, table \ref{TCELL2} and
\reffig{fig-convergence}. Diffusion coefficient computed from $\sim2000$
fundamental domain cycles of topological length up to 6 gives two
significant digits, while the elementary cell calculation needs over
$\sim 10000$ cycles in order to converge. In other words, the fundamental
domain cycles suggests a better and denser partition of the phase space.
    \TZ{2015-10-19}{Talk about other two methods}.

To further test \refeq{eq-meanSquareDisp}, we compute the diffusion
coefficient for $w/r = 0.05, 0.10, 0.15, 0.20, 0.25, 0.30$, and compare
the results with existing numerical experiments and a recent statistical
estimation, \reffig{fig-results}. In Green-Kubol velocity
auto-correlation method the  diffusion coefficient can be extrapolated to
the accurate reference value $0.250$ (at $w/r=0.30$), using ensembles of
$10^6\sim10^7$ gas particles flying for long time $T>20$ (and the number
of bounces is greater than this)\rf{MacZwa83}. On the other hand, while
statistical approach yields a smooth analytical
formula\rf{Angstmann20121819}, the diffusion property is fundamentally
never a smooth, monotonically increasing function of $w$
    \TZ{2015-11-02}
    {what is that 1D diffusion reference that shows the anywhere
    continuous, nowhere smooth curve?}
Again, the effectiveness (yet correctness) of the cycle expansion is
proved by those comparison.
