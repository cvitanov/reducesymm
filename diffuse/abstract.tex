% Diffuse globally, compute locally: a cyclist tale

We present a precise computation of the diffusion constant (not a numerical
simulation, but evaluation by means of an exact periodic orbit theory formula)
for a periodic hexagonal Lorentz gas with a finite horizon. A symbolic
description of the dynamics reduced to a fundamental domain ($1/12$ of the
hexagonal elementary cell whose translations tile the entire plane) is obtained
by a new approach to tiling the plane by actions of three elementary tiling
generators. This enables us, in contrast to earlier literature, to reduce the
calculation to relative prime periodic orbits computed in the fundamental domain.

Applied to a dilute Lorentz gas with finite horizon, the theory works well, but
for the dense Lorentz gas the convergence is hampered by the strong pruning of
the admissible orbits.
Compared with previous literature, our fundamental domain value of the
diffusion constant converges quickly for disk-disk separation/disk radius
$>0.2$, with the cycle expansion truncated to only a few hundred periodic
orbits of up to $5$ billiard wall bounces. For small disk-disk separations,
with periodic orbits up to $6$ bounces, our diffusion constants are close
($<10\%$) to direct numerical simulation estimates, as well as the recent
literature probabilistic estimates.
