\section{Introduction}

The advances in the theory of dynamical systems have brought a new life to Boltzmann's mechanical formulation of statistical mechanics. Sinai, Ruelle and Bowen (SRB) have generalized Boltzmann's notion of ergodicity for a constant energy surface for a Hamiltonian system in equilibrium to dissipative systems in {nonequilibrium} stationary states. In this more general setting the attractor plays the role of a constant energy surface, and the SRB measure x is a generalization of the Liouville measure. Such measures are purely microscopic and indifferent to whether the system is at equilibrium, close to equilibrium or far from it. ``Far for equilibrium'' in this context refers to systems with large deviations from Maxwell's equilibrium velocity distribution. Furthermore, the theory of dynamical systems has yielded new sets of microscopic dynamics formulas for macroscopic observables such as diffusion constants, to which we turn now.

Chaotic motions exist in many systems. There are physical problems such as beam defocusing in particle accelerators (ref?) or chaotic behavior of passive tracers in $2$\dmn\ rotating flows~\cite{solomon1994chaotic} which can be described as deterministic diffusion in periodic arrays. In biological field, many important dynamical processes (often at cellular level) are described in terms of diffusion coefficients. Such examples include the transport of ions across the cell membranes~\cite{stein2012transport} and the movement of microorganism (e.g. bacterials) through natural ecosystems~\cite{koch1990diffusion}. In this paper we will discuss the transport property of more "macroscopic" systems (such as moving robots~\cite{saranli2001rhex}) where a ``diffusive description'' also applies. 

Lately, there has been an increased focus on robot locomotion in complex environments (check Science and ROPP reference, the systematic study of interactions between environment and locomotion, which we now called ``robophysics''). Many of those studies uses substrates that are spatially homogeneous and we have a relatively good understanding of it~\cite{li2009sensitive, li2013terradynamics}. However, little is known for locomotion in heterogeneous environment and there are only limited experiment/theory study in relative simple settings. In this paper we intend to understand the longterm transport properties of motion on heterogeneous terrain. The potential applications of this study such mars navigation, hazardous rescue.

We abstract the locomotion problem into the simplest setting. A passively controlled robot is moving in a boulder field at constant speed. We would want to study the long term dynamics of the system. The diffusion coefficient, which describes roughly how much area the robot explored in a unit time, is the key quantity here. We may place the boulder in a regular, periodic array and assume that we are in the heavy boulder limit such that after each collision event, only the robot is deflected and boulders remain immobilized. With these presumptions we effectively created a periodic Lorentz gas model~\cite{} for locomotion in a boulder field.

In the paper We apply cycle expansions to the analysis of {\em diffusion} properties of the system. The resulting formulas are exact; no probabilistic assumptions are made, and the all correlations are taken into account by the inclusion of cycles of all periods. The infinite extent systems for which the periodic orbit theory yields formulas for diffusion and other transport coefficients are spatially periodic, the global {\statesp} being tiled with copies of a elementary cell.

In \refsect{s-DiffPerArr} we briefly review the formulas for diffusion coefficients in a simple physical setting, the $2$\dmn\ periodic Lorentz gas, using dynamics restricted in elementary cell. In\refsect{s-SymmetryReduction} we consider further the rotational symmetry of the lattice and derive the diffusion coefficients using fundamental domain cycles. Because we will work with different kinds of \statesp s, through out the text we will repeatedly using tildes ($\tilde{\quad}$), nothings and hats ($\hat{\quad}$) atop symbols to signify the dynamical quantities in fundamental domain, elementary cell and full state space, respectively.

\section{Diffusion in periodic arrays}

\end{figure}

The $2$\dmn\ Lorentz gas is an infinite scatterer array in which diffusion of a light molecule in a gas of heavy scatterers is modeled by the motion of a point particle in a plane bouncing off an array of reflecting disks. The Lorentz gas is called ``gas'' as one can equivalently think of it as consisting of any number of point-like fast ``light molecules'' interacting only with the stationary ``heavy molecules'' and not among themselves.  As the scatterer array is built up from only defocusing concave surfaces, it is a pure hyperbolic system, and one of the simplest nontrivial dynamical systems that exhibits deterministic diffusion, \reffig{fig-chaoticBouncing}.

% The original Lorentz gas assumed a random distribution of heavy
% scatterers; in this case a probabilistic description is unavoidable.
\subsection{Formulation of Cycle Expansion Theory}
In \refref{cvitanovic1992investigation} we have shown that the {\em  periodic} Lorentz  gas is amenable to a purely deterministic treatment, and have derived the cycle expansion formula to calculate global dynamical quantities such like Lyapunov exponent and diffusion coefficient, using dynamics in the elementary cell. For any dynamical system that has translational symmetry, the full state space $\hM$ (i.e., both spatial coordinates and momenta) has a periodic tiling \[\hM=\bigcup_{ \hn \in T} \pS_{\hn},\] by {\em translating} $\pS_{\hn}$ of an {\em elementary cell} $\pS$, with $T$ the abelian group of lattice translations. 

In the context of Lorentz gas system, the elementary cell is the hexagon region (\reffig{fig-schrieberFig1}) centered at the scatterer. The dynamics restricted inside the elementary cell is understood as the periodic boundary condition: when the particle leaves the edge of the hexagon cell, it immediately enters the region again from the opposite edge. We distinguish two types of diffusive behavior; the {\em infinite horizon} case, which allows for infinite length flights, and the {\em finite horizon} case, where any free particle trajectory must hit a disk in finite time. The transition between horizon and infinite horizon is controlled by the ratio of $w/r$, where $w$ is the gap between nearest pair of disk and $r$ the radius of the disk.   

We shall now relate the dynamics in $\pS$ to diffusive properties of the Lorentz gas in $\hM$. Let $\hx(t)\,=\,\hflow{}{\hx_0}$ denotes the point in the global space $\hM$ reached by the flow in time $t$. $x(t)\,=\,\flow{}{\xInit}$ denotes the corresponding flow in the elementary cell; the two are related by
\beq
\hn_t(\xInit)= \hflow{\xInit} - \flow{\xInit} \in T
\,,
\ee{l-diff-hatn} 
the translation of the endpoint of the global path into the elementary cell $\pS$.

Fix a vector $\beta \in \reals^d$, where $d$ is the dimension of the {\statesp}. We will compute the diffusive properties of the Lorentz gas from the leading eigenvalue of the Rulle-Frobenius-Perron \evOper\
\beq
\eigenvL(\beta)\,=\, \lim_{t \rightarrow \infty} \frac{1}{t} \log
\langle e^{\beta \cdot (\hx(t) -x) } \rangle_\pS
~, \quad
\ee{lor-diff-1} 
where the average is over all initial points in the elementary cell, $x \in \pS$. %, $\tx \in {\widetilde \pS}$ respectively.

If all odd derivatives vanish by symmetry, there is no drift and the second derivatives
\[
2d D_{ij} =
\left . {{\partial} \over {\partial \beta_i}}
{{\partial} \over {\partial \beta_j}}
\eigenvL(\beta)\right |_{\beta=0} \,=\,\lim_{t\rightarrow \infty} {1\over t}
\langle {(\hx(t) -x)_i (\hx(t) -x)_j } \rangle_\pS ~,
\]
yield a diffusion matrix.  This symmetric matrix can, in general, be anisotropic (\ie, have $d$ distinct eigenvalues and eigen\-vectors). The spatial diffusion constant is then given by the Einstein relation 
\[
D\,=\,{1\over 2 d} \sum_i
\left .{{\partial}^2 \over {\partial \beta^2_i}}
\eigenvL(\beta)\right |_{\beta=0}
\,=\, \lim_{t\rightarrow \infty} {1\over{2d t}}
\langle {(\hat{q}(t) -q)^2 } \rangle_\pS~
~,
\]
where the $i$ sum is restricted to the spatial components $q_i$ of the {\statesp} vectors $x=(q,p)$, \ie, if the dynamics is Hamiltonian, the sum is over the $d$ degrees of freedom.

% PC{reinstate mass, velocity, size to get $\beta$, $m$, $\sigma dependencies right}

We now turn to the connection between \refeq{lor-diff-1} and periodic orbits in the elementary cell, which is given by the spectrum of the operator
\beq
\det(\eigenvL (\beta) - \Aop)  \,=\,\prod_{p}
\exp \left( - {
               \sum_{r=1}^\infty {1 \over r}
               {
                e^{(\beta \cdot \hn_p- s \period{p}) r}
                    % z^{\cl{p} r}
 \over  \oneMinJ{r}
                }
  % { | \det \left( {\bf 1}-\monodromy_p^{r} \right) | } }
              } \right)
\,,
\ee{lor-diff-14}
or the corresponding \dzeta\
\beq
1/\zeta(\beta, s)\,=\,\prod_{p}\left( 1 - \frac{e^{(\beta \cdot
\hn_p- s \period{p})}}{|\ExpaEig_p|} \right)
~.
\label{zeta-diff}
\eeq
The \dzeta\ \cycForm\ for the diffusion constant, zero mean drift
$
\expct{ \hat{x}_i } = 0
\,,
$
is given by
\beq
D \,=\,{1 \over 2 d} { \expct{\hat{x}^2}_\zeta \over \expct{\period{}}_\zeta }
  \,=\,{1 \over 2 d } \, {1 \over \expct{\period{}}_\zeta}
  \sumprime \frac{(-1)^{k+1}
  (\hn_{p_1}+ \cdots+ \hn_{p_k})^2}
  {|\ExpaEig_{p_1}\cdots \ExpaEig_{p_k}|}
\, .
\label{(17)}
\eeq
where the sum is over all distinct non-repeating combination of prime cycles (in the elementary cell). The derivation is standard, still the formula is strange. Diffusion is unbounded motion across an infinite lattice; nevertheless, the reduction to the elementary cell enables us to compute relevant quantities in the usual way, in terms of periodic orbits.

\section{Into the fundamental domain\label{s-SymmetryReduction}
}

 When the scattering array has further discrete symmetries, such as reflection symmetry, each elementary cell may be built from a {\em fundamental domain} ${\widetilde \pS}$ by the action of a discrete (not necessarily abelian) group $G$. The quantity $\tx(t)\,=\,\tflow{t}{\tx}$ denotes the flow in the fundamental domain ${\widetilde \pS}$; $\tflow{t}{\tx}$ is related to $\flow{}{\tx}$ by a discrete symmetry $g \in G$ which maps $\tx(t)\in {\widetilde \pS}$ to ${x}(t) \in {\pS}$. The full $\hM \rightarrow {\widetilde \pS}$ reduction is complicated by the non-abelian nature of $G$, and will be illustrated in this section in detail.

\subsection{Grammar of Fundamental Domain cycle}

\includegraphics[width=0.45\textwidth]{diffuseFDSymbolIllustration}
\caption{\label{fig-fdflights} Fundamental domain symbolic dynamics. With imposed finite horizon and starting on the edge of a disk in fundamental domain (the green filled region), there are at most 6 disks can be reached without collision (disk $\overline{0},\overline{1},\overline{2},\overline{4},\overline{10}$ and $\overline{11}$). Similar to how elementary cell symbolic dynamics are created, we label the 12 triangular pieces of a disk in a counter clock-wise manner, from $\underline{0}$ to $\underline{11}$. The combination of a disk label and a triangular piece label $\{\overline{i},\underline{j}\}$ uniquely identifies a free flight. XX (figure showing how this symbolic system corresponds to cycles).}

(b) \includegraphics[width=0.45\textwidth]{7diskFundDtiles}
\end{center}
\caption{\label{fig-7diskFundDflips} (a) The three generators of tiling of the plane by a fundamental domain: two generators of \Dn{12} tiling, reflection $s$ across the short disk-disk separation, reflection  $\ell$  across the long disk-disk separation; and a translation generator $f$ that pivots (`flips') a disk center to disk center by flip across the symmetry line normal to the short disk-disk separation. (5) Tiling of the 7-disk by copies of the fundamental domain, labelled by a (not unique) sequence of the three generators $\{s,\ell,f\}$, chosen so that each sequence contain one and only on disk-to-disk pivot $f$. }
\end{figure}
XX I do not really use the three generators to compute the FD domain cycles, instead I use the idea of topological flights (\reffig{fig-fdflights}). 

\subsection{How point group changes translation}

Starting from each point on the cycle, the translation in full space is different after completion of one cycle. 



\subsection{Gymnastics of equations}

\Group-equivariance of the displacement in the full space.

\begin{align}
\tr{\cal L}^t &=
\sum_{\alpha \in\II_G} \tr{\cal L}_{\alpha}^t\nonumber\\
\tr{\cal L}_{\alpha}^t &=
\frac{d_\alpha}{|G|}\sum_{\sigma \in G}\sum_{h\in G}\chi_\alpha(h)
\int_{\t {\cal M}} d\tx \delta (h\tx - f^t(\tx))
e^{\beta\cdot\sigma\cdot\hphi^t(\tx)}~,
\label{e1}
\end{align}

\begin{align}
\frac{1}{\zeta_{\alpha}(\beta,s,z)} &=\exp\left(
-\frac{d_\alpha}{|G|}\sum_{\sigma\in G}\sum_{\tp}\frac{1}{n_{\tp}}
\sum_{\tx_{i}\in\tilde{p}}\sum_{r=1}^{\infty}
\frac{t_{\tp}^{r}}{r}\chi_{\alpha}(\hp^{r}(\tx_i))
e^{\beta\cdot\sigma\cdot\hat{L}_{\tp}(r,\tx_i)}
\right)
\end{align}
where we have defined
\begin{equation}
t_{\tp}\equiv \frac{z^{n_{\tp}}e^{-sT_{\tp}}}{|\ExpaEig_\tp|}
\end{equation}
and
\begin{equation}
\hat{L}_{\tp}(r,\tx_i)\equiv (e+\hp^{-1}(\tx_i)\cdots+\hp^{-r+1}(\tx_i))\cdot\hn_{\tp}(\tx_i)
\end{equation}

We are interested in the one dimensional, symmetric trivial
representation with $ d_\alpha = 1 $ and all $ \chi(h) = 1 $,; there by
we drop the subscript $ \alpha $ in the following calculation. Partial
derivative with respect to $\beta$:
\bea
\frac{\partial^{2}}{\partial\beta^{2}}\frac{1}{\zeta(\beta,s,z)}
 &=\frac{1}{\zeta(\beta,s,z)}\left(\left(\frac{1}{|G|}
\sum_{\sigma\in G}\sum_{\tp}\sum_{\tx_i\in \tp}\sum_{r=1}^{\infty}\frac{\sigma\cdot \hat{L}_{\tp}(r,\tx_i)t_{\tp}^r e^{\beta\cdot\sigma\cdot \hat{L}_{\tp}(r,\tx_i)}}{n_{\tp}r}\right)^{2}\right.\nonumber\\
 & \left.-\frac{1}{|G|}\sum_{\sigma\in G}\left(\sum_{\tp}\sum_{\tx_i\in \tp}\sum_{r=1}^{\infty}\frac{\vert \sigma\cdot \hat{L}_{\tp}(r,\tx_i)\vert^{2}t_{\tp}^{r}e^{\beta\cdot\sigma\cdot \hat{L}_{\tp}(r,\tx_i)}}{n_{p}r}\right)\right).
\eea
The first term in the formula corresponds to $ \langle\hx\rangle^2 $ and
second to $ \langle\hx^2\rangle $
