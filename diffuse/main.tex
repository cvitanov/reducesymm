\section{Introduction}

The advances in the theory of dynamical systems have brought a new life to
Boltzmann's mechanical formulation of statistical mechanics. Sinai, Ruelle and
Bowen (SRB) have generalized Boltzmann's notion of ergodicity for a constant
energy surface for a Hamiltonian system in equilibrium to dissipative systems in
{nonequilibrium} stationary states. In this more general setting the attractor
plays the role of a constant energy surface, and the SRB measure x is a
generalization of the Liouville measure. Such measures are purely microscopic
and indifferent to whether the system is at equilibrium, close to equilibrium or
far from it.  ``Far for equilibrium'' in this context refers to systems with
large deviations from Maxwell's equilibrium velocity distribution. Furthermore,
the theory of dynamical systems has yielded new sets of microscopic dynamics
formulas for macroscopic observables such as diffusion constants, to which we turn now.

Chaotic motions exist in many field of physics systems, blah. Thre are physical
problems such as beam defocusing in particle accelerators or chaotic behavior of
passive tracers in $2$\dmn\ rotating flows which can be described as
deterministic diffusion in periodic arrays. In the field of animal/robotic
locomotion, we will show that a macroscopic ``diffusion view'' also applies.

Lately, there has been an increased focus on locomotion in complex environments. Researches in the physical sciences and in the field of robotics all find interest/relevance to this topic. (Now we can have a list of reference and recent studies in this topic). Many of those studies uses substrates that are spatially homogeneous and we have a relatively good understanding of it. Little is understood for locomotion in heterogeneous environment and principles are still lacking. Our lab is interested to study the transport properties of locomotors moving on heterogeneous terrain. Such study may potentially be beneficial to practical applications such mars navigation, hazardous rescue.

We consider the following locomotion problem. A passively controlled robot is moving in a boulder field at constant speed. We would want to study the long term dynamics of the system. The diffusion coefficient, which describes roughly how much area the robot explored in a unit time, is the key quantity here. We may place the boulder in a regular, periodic array and assume that we are in the heavy boulder limit such that after each collision event, only the robot is deflected and boudlers remain immobalized. With these preasumptions we effectively created a lorentz gas model for locomotion in a boulder field.

We shall apply cycle expansions to the analysis of {\em transport} properties of
chaotic systems. The resulting formulas are exact; no probabilistic assumptions
are made, and the all correlations are taken into account by the inclusion of
cycles of all periods.  The infinite extent systems for which the periodic orbit
theory yields formulas for diffusion and other transport coefficients are
spatially periodic, the global {\statesp} being tiled with copies of a
elementary cell.

In \refsect{s-DiffPerArr} we derive the formulas for diffusion
coefficients in a simple physical setting, the $2$\dmn\ periodic Lorentz
gas in elementary cell. In\refsect{s-SymmetryReduction} we consider further the rotational symmetry of the Lorentz gas system and derive the diffusion coefficients in fundamental domain.

\section{Diffusion in periodic arrays}
\label{s-DiffPerArr}

\caption[]{\label{fig:schrieberFig1}}
Motion in fundamental domain (FD), elementary cell (EC) and full space.
\end{figure}

The $2$\dmn\ Lorentz gas is an infinite scatterer array in which
diffusion of a light molecule in a gas of heavy scatterers is modeled
by the motion of a point particle in a plane bouncing off an array of
reflecting disks.  The Lorentz gas is called ``gas'' as one can
equivalently think of it as consisting of any number of pointlike fast
``light molecules'' interacting only with the stationary ``heavy
molecules'' and not among themselves.  As the scatterer array is built
up from only defocusing concave surfaces, it is a pure hyperbolic
system, and one of the simplest nontrivial dynamical systems that
exhibits deterministic diffusion, \reffig{fig-lor-4}.
% The original Lorentz gas assumed a random distribution of heavy
% scatterers; in this case a probabilistic description is unavoidable.
We shall now show that the {\em periodic} Lorentz gas is amenable to a
purely deterministic treatment.  In this class of open dynamical
systems quantities characterizing global dynamics, such as the
Lyapunov exponent, pressure and diffusion constant, can be computed
from the dynamics restricted to the elementary cell.  The method
applies to any hyperbolic dynamical system that is a periodic tiling
$\hM=\bigcup_{ \hn \in T} \pS_{\hn}$ of the dynamical {\statesp} $\hM$
by {\em translates} $\pS_{\hn}$ of an {\em elementary cell} $\pS$,
with $T$ the abelian group of lattice translations.  If the scattering
array has further discrete symmetries, such as reflection symmetry,
each elementary cell may be built from a {\em fundamental domain}
${\widetilde \pS}$ by the action of a discrete (not necessarily
abelian) group $G$.  The symbol $\hM$ refers here to the full
{\statesp}, \ie,, both the spatial coordinates and the momenta.  The
spatial component of $\hM$ is the complement of the disks in the {\em
whole} space.

We shall now relate the dynamics in $\pS$ to diffusive properties of
the Lorentz gas in $\hM$.

These concepts are best illustrated by a specific example, a Lorentz
gas based on the hexagonal lattice Sinai billiard of
\reffig{fig:schrieberFig1}.

We distinguish two types of diffusive behavior; the {\em infinite
horizon} case, which allows for infinite length flights, and the {\em
finite horizon} case, where any free particle trajectory must hit a
disk in finite time. 

As we will work with three kinds of \statesp s, good manners require
that we repeat what tildes, nothings and hats atop symbols signify:
\bea
\tilde{\ }     &&
    \mbox{fundamental domain, triangle in \reffig{fig:schrieberFig1}}
        \continue
%[nothing] \qquad \qquad &&
[0pt] \qquad \qquad &&
    \mbox{elementary cell, hexagon in \reffig{fig:schrieberFig1}}
        \continue
\hat{\ }   &&
    \mbox{full {\statesp}, lattice in \reffig{fig:schrieberFig1}}
\label{atops}
\eea
It is convenient to define an \evOper\ for each of the 3 cases of
\reffig{fig-lor-1}.
$\hx(t)\,=\,\hflow{t}{\hx}$
denotes the point in the global space
$\hM$
reached by the flow in time $t$.
$x(t)\,=\,\flow{t}{\xInit}$
denotes the corresponding flow in the elementary cell; the two are
related by
\beq
\hn_t(\xInit)= \hflow{t}{\xInit} - \flow{t}{\xInit} \in T
\,,
\ee{l-diff-hatn}
the translation of the endpoint of the global path into the elementary
cell $\pS$.  The quantity $\tx(t)\,=\,\tflow{t}{\tx}$ denotes the flow
in the fundamental domain
${\widetilde \pS}$;
$\tflow{t}{\tx}$ is related to
$\flow{t}{\tx}$ by a discrete symmetry
$g \in G$ which maps $\tx(t)\in {\widetilde \pS}$ to
${x}(t) \in {\pS}$ .

Fix a vector $\beta \in \reals^d$, where $d$ is the dimension of the
{\statesp}. We will compute the diffusive properties of the Lorentz
gas from the leading eigenvalue of the
\evOper\ \refeq{(2)}
\beq
\eigenvL(\beta)\,=\, \lim_{t \rightarrow \infty} \frac{1}{t} \log
\langle e^{\beta \cdot (\hx(t) -x) } \rangle_\pS
~, \quad
\ee{lor-diff-1}
where the average is over all initial points in the elementary cell,
$x \in \pS$. %, $\tx \in {\widetilde \pS}$ respectively.

If all odd derivatives vanish by symmetry, there is no drift and the
second derivatives
\[
2d D_{ij} =
\left . {{\partial} \over {\partial \beta_i}}
{{\partial} \over {\partial \beta_j}}
\eigenvL(\beta)\right |_{\beta=0} \,=\,\lim_{t\rightarrow \infty} {1\over t}
\langle {(\hx(t) -x)_i (\hx(t) -x)_j } \rangle_\pS ~,
\] %ee{lor-diff-4}
yield a diffusion matrix.  This symmetric matrix can, in general, be
anisotropic (\ie, have $d$ distinct eigenvalues and eigen\-vectors).
The spatial diffusion constant is then given by the Einstein relation
\refeq{(5)}
\[
D\,=\,{1\over 2 d} \sum_i
\left .{{\partial}^2 \over {\partial \beta^2_i}}
\eigenvL(\beta)\right |_{\beta=0}
\,=\, \lim_{t\rightarrow \infty} {1\over{2d t}}
\langle {(\hat{q}(t) -q)^2 } \rangle_\pS~
~,
\] %ee{lor_diff_5}
where the $i$ sum is restricted to the spatial components $q_i$ of the
{\statesp} vectors $x=(q,p)$, \ie, if the dynamics is Hamiltonian, the
sum is over the $d$ degrees of freedom.

PC{reinstate mass, velocity, size to get $\beta$, $m$, $\sigma$

We now turn to the connection between \refeq{lor-diff-1} and periodic
orbits in the elementary cell.As the full $\hM \rightarrow {\widetilde
\pS}$ reduction is complicated by the non-abelian nature of $G$, we

\tr{\cal L}_{\alpha}^t &=

\int_{\t {\cal M}} d\tx \delta (h\tx - f^t(\tx))

\end{align}

\begin{align}
\frac{1}{\zeta_{\alpha}(\beta,s,z)} &=\exp\left(
-\frac{d_\alpha}{|G|}\sum_{\sigma\in G}\sum_{\tp}\frac{1}{n_{\tp}}
\sum_{\tx_{i}\in\tilde{p}}\sum_{r=1}^{\infty}
\frac{t_{\tp}^{r}}{r}\chi_{\alpha}(\hp^{r}(\tx_i))
e^{\beta\cdot\sigma\cdot\hat{L}_{\tp}(r,\tx_i)}
\right)
\end{align}
where we have defined
\begin{equation}
t_{\tp}\equiv \frac{z^{n_{\tp}}e^{-sT_{\tp}}}{|\ExpaEig_\tp|}
\end{equation}
and
\begin{equation}
\hat{L}_{\tp}(r,\tx_i)\equiv (e+\hp^{-1}(\tx_i)\cdots+\hp^{-r+1}(\tx_i))\cdot\hn_{\tp}(\tx_i)
\end{equation}

We are interested in the one dimensional, symmetric trivial
representation with $ d_\alpha = 1 $ and all $ \chi(h) = 1 $,; there by
we drop the subscript $ \alpha $ in the following calculation. Partial
derivative with respect to $\beta$:
\begin{align}
\frac{\partial^{2}}{\partial\beta^{2}}\frac{1}{\zeta(\beta,s,z)}
 &=\frac{1}{\zeta(\beta,s,z)}\left(\left(\frac{1}{|G|}
\sum_{\sigma\in G}\sum_{\tp}\sum_{\tx_i\in \tp}\sum_{r=1}^{\infty}\frac{\sigma\cdot \hat{L}_{\tp}(r,\tx_i)t_{\tp}^r e^{\beta\cdot\sigma\cdot \hat{L}_{\tp}(r,\tx_i)}}{n_{\tp}r}\right)^{2}\right.\nonumber\\
 & \left.-\frac{1}{|G|}\sum_{\sigma\in G}\left(\sum_{\tp}\sum_{\tx_i\in \tp}\sum_{r=1}^{\infty}\frac{\vert \sigma\cdot \hat{L}_{\tp}(r,\tx_i)\vert^{2}t_{\tp}^{r}e^{\beta\cdot\sigma\cdot \hat{L}_{\tp}(r,\tx_i)}}{n_{p}r}\right)\right).
\end{align}
The first term in the formula corresponds to $ \langle\hx\rangle^2 $ and
second to $ \langle\hx^2\rangle $
