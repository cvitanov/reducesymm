When, in addition to translational invariance, the elementary cell is
invariant under a discrete symmetry group (point group) $G$, the
lattice can be tiled into images under $G$ and the lattice
translations of a fundamental domain. In \refsect{s-Lorentz} we had
reduced a trajectory from full space to elementary cell, as in
\reffig{fig-schrieberFig12}\,(a), upper right, using the translational
symmetry, and were able to compute various quantities in terms of
elementary cell \po s. In this section we will further utilize the 
point group symmetry to derive the fully symmetry-reduced trace 
formula and, for the first time, the diffusion constant using cycles 
restricted to the fundamental domain.

As we will work with three kinds of \statesp s, we state here what
tildes, nothings and hats atop symbols signify:
\bea
\tilde{\ }     &~~&
    \mbox{fundamental domain, triangle in \reffig{fig-schrieberFig12}}
        \continue
%[nothing] \qquad \qquad &&
[0pt] \qquad \qquad &&
    \mbox{elementary cell, hexagon in \reffig{fig-schrieberFig12}}
        \continue
\hat{\ }   &&
    \mbox{full {\statesp}, lattice in \reffig{fig-schrieberFig12}}
\label{atops}
\eea

In addition to the full space and elementary cell \evOper\ , we denote
the quantity $\tx(t)\,=\,\tflow{t}{\tx}$ as the flow in the
fundamental domain ${\widetilde \pS}$. $\tflow{t}{\tx}$ is related to
$\flow{t}{\tx}$ by a discrete symmetry $g \in G$ which maps $\tx(t)\in
{\widetilde \pS}$ to ${x}(t) \in {\pS}$.


We have shown in \ref{s-POT} that the displacement traveled along a
cycle is independent of the starting point for the
dynamics in the elementary cell. When we take into account
the point group symmetry (i.e. rotations and reflections), the above
statement does  not stand. While a full space (or elementary cell)
trajectory can be uniquely reduced to its fundamental domain counter
part by wrapping (reflecting and rotating) all the individual segments
in different fundamental domain into a single one, the reverse process
is always one-to-many. Because the fundamental domain does not have the
concepts of absolute orientation, a single unwrapped trajectory may
have up-to 12 isometric copies after we apply the discrete group
actions. Even worse, depending on where we start to unwrap the
trajectory, the full space trajectories can be completely different in
shape. A precise mathematical treatment is necessary to address the
above effects, before we can proceed to the complete formula for
diffusion, which depends on descriptions of displacements.

%When the scattering array has a discrete symmetries, such as
%reflection symmetry, each elementary cell may be built from a {\em
%fundamental domain} ${\widetilde \pS}$ by the action of a discrete (not
%necessarily abelian) group $G$. The quantity $\tx(t)\,=\,\tflow{t}{\tx}$
%denotes the flow in the fundamental domain ${\widetilde \pS}$;
%$\tflow{t}{\tx}$ is related to$\flow{}{\tx}$ by a discrete symmetry $g
%\in G$ which maps $\tx(t)\in{\widetilde \pS}$ to ${x}(t) \in {\pS}$. The
%full $\hM \rightarrow {\widetilde\pS}$ reduction is complicated by the
%non-abelian nature of $G$, and will be illustrated in this section in
%detail.

\subsection{Point group changes translation \label{s-FundTranslation}}

A point $\ssp$ in the elementary cell is identified by its
fundamental domain mirror image:
\[ %beq
\ssp=g\,\tx,
\] %eeq
given a little group action $g\in G$. We have to appreciate that both
the full space flow $\hflow{t}{\ssp}$ and elementary flow
$\flow{t}{\ssp} $ is G-equivariant under the lattice group symmetry,.
\beq
\hflow{t}{g\,\tx} = g\,\hflow{t}{\tx}\,,
\flow{t}{g\,\tx} = g\,\flow{t}{\tx}\,,
\label{eq-equivariance-flow}
\eeq

It follows that the displacement in full space is also G-equivariant 
under the little group:
\beq
\hn_t(\ssp)= \hflow{t}{g\,\tx} - \flow{t}{g\,\tx}=g\,(\hflow{t}{\tx} - \flow{t}{\tx}) = g\,\hn_t(\tx)\,.
\label{eq-equivariance-disp}
\eeq

However, the nice property does not automatically resolve the problem 
at hand. When the dynamics is restricted in the fundamental domain, 
we lose the absolute orientation. We show this 
by following a prime periodic orbit $\tp$ in the fundamental domain.


Let $\tp\equiv\{\tx_1,\ldots,\tx_{\cl{\tp}}\}$, with topological
length $\cl{\tp}$ and $\tx_i$ the points of collision on the orbit.
Starting from the edge of disk at $\tx_i$, at some point the flight
will meet one of the triangle boundaries of the fundamental domain and
be deflected back. In the full space the particle continues to another
triangular domain, which, in general, does not have the same
orientation to the original copy (figure here). The relative change in
the orientation can always be described by a element of the little
group. Before the particle reaches the next collision point
$\tx_{i+1}$, it has crossed multiple boundaries (or symmetry lines),
and we denote the cumulated change in the orientation $g_\tp(\tx_{i},
\tx_{i+1})$.

Denote the displacement of flight $(\tx_i, \tx_{i+1})$ as 
$\hn_{\tp}(\tx_i, \tx_{i+1})$, the added displacement from 
$\tx_i$ to $\tx_{i+2}$ is
\beq
    \hn_{\tp}(\tx_i, \tx_{i+2}) = \hn_{\tp}(\tx_i, \tx_{i+1}) + 
    g_\tp(\tx_{i}, \tx_{i+1})\hn_{\tp}(\tx_{i+1}, \tx_{i+2})\,,
\eeq
i.e. we have to memorize the change in the relative orientation. 
Applying this rule to the entire cycle, we have (after applying a 
cyclic shift $\cl{\tp} + 1 \to 1$)
\beq
\hn_{\tp}(\tx_{1})=\sum_{i=1}^{\cl{\tp}}g_{\tp}(\tx_{1}, 
\tx_{i})\,\hn(\tx_{i}, \tx_{i+1}),
\eeq
where the left order product $g_{\tp}(\tx_{1}, 
\tx_i)=\prod_{j=1}^{i-1} g_\tp(\tx_{j},\tx_{j+1})$, and 
$g_{\tp}(\tx_1, \tx_1) = e$. Unlike in the elementary cell, the 
displacement in general is dependent on the starting point.
%\beq
%\hn_{\tp}(\tx_2) = g_{\tp}^{-1}(\tx_1, \tx_2)(\hn_{\tp}(\tx_{1}) - 
%\hn_{\tp}(\tx_1, \tx_2)) + h_{\tp}(\tx_1)\hn_{\tp}(\tx_1, \tx_2)
%\eeq
We define the total group action (orientation change) for the orbit
\beq
h_{\tp}(\tx_1)=\prod_{i=1}^{\cl{\tp}} 
g_\tp(\tx_{i},\tx_{i+1})\,,
\label{eq-cyclegrp-fd}
\eeq
which immediately connects the flow in fundamental domain and 
elementary cell by
\beq
\flow{t_\tp}{\tx_i}=h_{\tp}(\tx_i)\tflow{t_\tp}{\tx_i}\,.
\eeq

Although the group action $h_{\tp}(\tx_i)$ depends on the initial 
points on the orbit as well, it is a property of the orbit's 
symmetry. One can easily show that all $h_{\tp}(\tx_i), \tx_i\in\tp$ 
belong to the \emph{same} subgroup of $G$, using 
\refeq{eq-cyclegrp-fd}

\beq
h_{\tp}(\tx_{i+1}) = g_{\tp}^{-1}(\tx_i, \tx_{i+1})\, 
h_{\tp}(\tx_{i})\,g_{\tp}(\tx_i, \tx_{i+1})\,.
\eeq


If we let the particle (starting from $\tx_i$) travel along the 
fundamental domain orbit $r$ times, the result displacement is 
\beq
\hat{L}_{\tp}^{r}(\tx_i)\equiv
(e+\hp^{1}(\tx_i)+\cdots+\hp^{r-1}(\tx_i))\cdot\hn_{\tp}(\tx_i)\,.
\label{eq-fd-displacement}
\eeq
