As we will work with three kinds of \statesp s,
we state here what tildes, nothings and hats atop symbols signify:
\bea
\tilde{\ }     &&
    \mbox{fundamental domain, triangle in \reffig{fig-schrieberFig12}}
        \continue
%[nothing] \qquad \qquad &&
[0pt] \qquad \qquad &&
    \mbox{elementary cell, hexagon in \reffig{fig-schrieberFig12}}
        \continue
\hat{\ }   &&
    \mbox{full {\statesp}, lattice in \reffig{fig-schrieberFig12}}
\label{atops}
\eea
It is convenient to define an \evOper\ for each of the 3
cases of \reffig{fig-schrieberFig12}.
$\hx(t)\,=\,\hflow{t}{\hx}$
denotes the point in the global space
$\hM$
reached by the flow in time $t$.
$x(t)\,=\,\flow{t}{\xInit}$
denotes the corresponding flow in the elementary cell;
the two are related by
\beq
\hn_t(\xInit)= \hflow{t}{\xInit} - \flow{t}{\xInit} \in T
\,,
\ee{l-diff-hatn}
the translation of the endpoint of the global path into the elementary
cell $\pS$. The quantity $\tx(t)\,=\,\tflow{t}{\tx}$ denotes the flow in
the fundamental domain ${\widetilde \pS}$; $\tflow{t}{\tx}$ is related to
$\flow{t}{\tx}$ by a discrete symmetry $g \in G$ which maps
$\tx(t)\in {\widetilde \pS}$ to ${x}(t) \in {\pS}$ .

When the scattering array has a discrete symmetries, such as
reflection symmetry, each elementary cell may be built from a {\em
fundamental domain} ${\widetilde \pS}$ by the action of a discrete (not
necessarily abelian) group $G$. The quantity $\tx(t)\,=\,\tflow{t}{\tx}$
denotes the flow in the fundamental domain ${\widetilde \pS}$;
$\tflow{t}{\tx}$ is related to$\flow{}{\tx}$ by a discrete symmetry $g
\in G$ which maps $\tx(t)\in{\widetilde \pS}$ to ${x}(t) \in {\pS}$. The
full $\hM \rightarrow {\widetilde\pS}$ reduction is complicated by the
non-abelian nature of $G$, and will be illustrated in this section in
detail.

same amount in the full {\statesp}}

\subsection{How point group changes translation}

In the fundamental domain, one has to realize a few facts before
proceeding to the cycle expansion derivation. A point $\ssp$ in the
elementary cell is be uniquely identified by its
fundamental domain ``mirror image'':
\[ %beq
\ssp=g\,\tx,
\] %eeq
given a group action the discrete symmetry group,  $g\in G$. In the
triangular periodic Lorentz gas the underlying point group is $C_{6v}=D_6$),
and the hexagonal elementary cell is tiled by
12 identical triangular tiles. We have to appreciate that the flow
$\hat{\phi}^t$ is G-equivariant under the lattice group symmetry, and
proceed with the argument that the displacement in full space is also
equivariant under the point group symmetry (which is a subset of the
lattice group):
\[ %beq
\hn_t(\ssp)\equiv\hn_t(g\,\tx)= g\,\hn_t(\tx).
\] %eeq
We can apply this fact to the displacement associated with a prime
periodic orbit $\tp$ restricted in the fundamental domain.
Let $\tp\equiv\{\tx_0,\tx_1,\ldots,\tx_{\cl{\tp}}\}$, with topological length
$\cl{\tp}$ and $\tx_i$ the bouncing points on the orbit. For each flight
(\eg, from $\tx_i$ to $\tx_{i+1}$) we denote the associated displacement
in full space $\hn(\tx_i,e)$. However, one has to be careful when adding
the individual displacements together when moving along a fundamental
domain orbit. Unlike in elementary cell, the fundamental domain point
$\tx_i$ does not distinguish in which triangular piece it is. Instead, we
assign a point group element $g_\tp(\tx_{i+1},\tx_{i})$ to keep track of
changes in absolute orientation. We now write the displacement traveled
along the orbit, after finishing a full cycle:
\beq
\hn_{\tp}(\tx_{0})=\sum_{i=0}^{\cl{\tp}-1}\hn(\tx_{i},g_{\tp,\tx_0}(\tx_{i}))
=\sum_{i=0}^{\cl{\tp}-1}g_{\tp,\tx_{0}}(\tx_{i})\,\hn(\tx_{i},e),
\eeq
where $g_{\tp,\tx_{0}}(\tx_i)=\prod_0^{j-1} g_\tp(\tx_{j+1},\tx_{j})$ is
the accumulated orientation changes along the orbit when starting from
$\tx_{0}$. The displacement now depends on the starting point. We denote
the total group action for the orbit
\bea
h_{\tp}(\tx_i)&\equiv& g_\tp(\tx_{i},\tx_{i-1})\,\ldots\,
g_\tp(\tx_{0},\tx_{\cl{\tp}-1})\nonumber\\
&& \, g_\tp(\tx_{\cl{\tp}-1},\tx_{\cl{\tp}-2})\, \ldots\,
g_\tp(\tx_{i+1},\tx_{i}),
\eea
which one can immediately see the connection
$\flow{t_\tp}{\tx_i}=h_{\tp}(\tx_i)\tflow{t_\tp}{\tx_i}$.
Although the group action $h_{\tp}(\tx_i)$ depends on the initial points
on the orbit, it is a property of the orbit's symmetry, and subsequently
all $h_{\tp}(\tx_i), \tx_i\in\tp$ belong to the \emph{same} subgroup of
$G$.

We define the quantity:
\beq
\hat{L}_{\tp}^{r}(\tx_i)\equiv
(e+\hp^{1}(\tx_i)+\cdots+\hp^{r-1}(\tx_i))\cdot\hn_{\tp}(\tx_i),
\label{eq-fdDisplacement}
\eeq
to be the displacement traveled along the orbit $r$ times, starting from
$\tx_i$.  Though one may not appreciate immediately,
\refeq{eq-fdDisplacement} takes care of the rotational symmetry that does
not commute with translation, and we will show that it gives the proper
displacement needed for computing diffusion coefficient in the
fundamental domain.
