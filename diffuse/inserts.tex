remark === {Who's dunnit?}{
Cycle expansions for the diffusion constant of a particle
moving in a periodic array have been introduced
%in May-June 1991
by R.~Artuso\rf{art91} (exact
\dzeta\ for $1$\dmn\ chains of maps  \refeq{(17)}),

and by
P. Cvitanovi\'c, J.-P. Eckmann, and P. Gaspard\rf{LorentzDiff}
(the \dzeta\ cycle expansion \refeq{(17)} applied to the  Lorentz gas).
%Vance refers to the Artuso article and Gaspard-Baras\rf{GB92},
%so perhaps his only independent contribution was to apply the
%method to the Lorentz gas.

remark === {Lack of structural stability for D.}{
Expressions like \refeq{D-KD} may lead to an expectation that
the diffusion coefficient (and thus transport properties) are
smooth functions of the chaoticity of the system
(parameterized, for example, by the Lyapunov exponent $\Lyap =
\ln \ExpaEig$). This turns out not to be true: $D$ as a
function of $\ExpaEig$ is a fractal, nowhere differentiable
curve shown in \reffig{f-Klage}. The dependence of $D$ on the
map parameter $\ExpaEig$ is rather unexpected - even though for
larger $\ExpaEig$ more points are mapped outside the unit cell
in one iteration, the diffusion constant does not necessarily
grow. We refer the reader to \refrefs{detdiff1,ScFrKa82} for
early work on the deterministic diffusion induced by 1\dmn\
maps. The sawtooth map \refeq{KD-map} was introduced by
Grossmann and Fujisaka\rf{GroFuj82} who derived the integer slope
formulas \refeq{D-KD} for the diffusion constant. The sawtooth
map is also discussed in \refrefs{GB92}. The fractal dependence
of diffusion constant on the map parameter is discussed in
\refrefs{RKdiss,KlaDor95,KlaDor97}. \refSect{s:ChaosGood} gives
a brief summary of the experimental implications; for the the
current state of the art of fractal transport coefficients consult
the first part of Klage's monograph\rf{RKbook07}. Would be nice if
someone would eventually check these predictions in
experiments...
Statistical
mechanicians tend to believe that such complicated behavior is
not to be expected in systems with very many degrees of
freedom, as the addition to a large integer dimension of a
number smaller than $1$ should be as unnoticeable as a
microscopic perturbation of a macroscopic quantity. No
fractal-like behavior of the conductivity for the Lorentz gas
has been detected so far\rf{LNRM94}.

remark === {Symmetry factorization in one dimension.}{
In the $\beta=0$ limit the dynamics
\refeq{sym2} is symmetric under $x \rightarrow -x$, and the
zeta functions factorize into products of zeta functions for
the symmetric and antisymmetric subspaces, as
described in \refexam{exam:Reflecti}:
\bea
{1 \over \zeta(0,z)} &=& {1 \over \zeta_{s}(0,z)}\,{1 \over \zeta_{a}(0,z)}
    \continue
 {\pde \over \pde z} { 1 \over \zeta} &=&
 { 1 \over \zeta_s} {\pde \over \pde z} { 1 \over \zeta_a}
 +
 { 1 \over \zeta_a} {\pde \over \pde z} { 1 \over \zeta_s}
\,.
\label{diffSymmetr}
\eea
The leading (material flow conserving) eigenvalue $z=1$ belongs
to the symmetric subspace
\(
{1 / \zeta_s(0,1)}=0
\),
so the derivatives \refeq{MeanTime} also depend
only on the symmetric subspace:
\bea
\expct{n}_\zeta &=&
   \left. z{\pde \over \pde z} {1 \over \zeta(0,z)}\right|_{z=1}
   \continue
&=&  {1 \over \zeta_{a}(0,z)}\, z{\pde \over \pde z}
    \left.{1 \over \zeta_{s}(0,z)}\right|_{z=1} \, .
\label{symm_der}
\eea
Implementing the symmetry factorization is convenient,
but not essential, at this level of computation.

remark === {Lorentz gas in the fundamental domain.}{
The vector valued nature of the moment-generating function \refeq{lor-diff-1} in
the case under consideration makes it difficult to perform a calculation of
the diffusion constant within the fundamental domain.
Yet we point out that, at least as regards scalar quantities, the
full reduction to $\tilde{\pS}$ leads to better estimates.

introduced in \refref{freddy}%

%The reflection symmetry of the problem
%also should be taken into account by the symbols.
%The right and left turns are not distinguished - instead,  one reads
%off a symbol whether the next
%turn has to be taken in the same or in the opposite sense.
%
%Lower case letters denote short flights between closeby disks, upper case
%denotes the long flights to the next nearest disks.
%Each symbol corresponds to a given relative change
%in direction. The exact amount of
%change depends on whether the last flight was
%long (odd label in the notation of the last section) or short (even label).
%Table~\ref{TSYM} and figures~\ref{FUN1} and~\ref{FUN2}  give the definition of
%the symbols.
%
% Christiansen~\cite{freddy} had
% originally proposed to denote symbols `f' and `F' by the same
% letter, thus reducing the size of the alphabet.
%We use two letters `f' and `F' together with the
%pruning rule that `f' can only follow an uppercase
%letter (\ie, a long segment) and `F' only a lowercase letter.
%The symbols given to an orbit by this scheme are invariant under all spatial
%symmetries of the system but not under the time reversal.
%The fact is that time reversal symmetry is included in the spatial
%symmetries, at least for running orbits, as a consequence of the
%absence of external fields, and of the geometry of the model.
%
%\LR{PLEASE, make sure that this comment makes sense}
%
%Of the possible twelve symbols,  `A', `B', `f' and `F'
%are pruned as soon as the horizon gets finite.
%\\
%(PC: finite or densely packed???)\\
%TS: finite !
%Among the remaining symbols there is
%still strong pruning,  reflected in the fact that
%for $w = 0.3$ the
%number of cycles of symbol length $n$
%does not grow like $8^n$ but roughly as
%$3^n$. Figure~5? shows
%\RA{insert fig. 5 from \refref{CGS92}}
%all the fundamental domain fixed
%points which are not pruned at $w=0.3$ together with an example
%of a pruned fixed point.
%
%
%Table~4 gives some impression of the pruning involved.
%In order that longer orbits be shadowed by shorter ones,
%for every combination of two symbols a two-cycle,
%and the fixed points corresponding to each of the symbols should exist.
%Two-cycles such as `ac', `aC', \ldots are missing while
%corresponding ``shadowing'' pseudo-cycles `a~c', `a~C' exist, and
%conversely, two-cycles occur where one of the symbols
%has no corresponding fixed point
%(e.g. the symbol `d' in `ad'). So
%the shadowing is largely disfunctional,
%at least as long as finite approximate Markov partitions are
%not developed.
%Nevertheless the finite order estimates for the Lyapunov exponent and
%material flow conservation, reported in \reftab{t-diff-5a}, are rather good, and noticeably
%better than the corresponding calculation using elementary cell dynamics
%(\reftab{t-diff-1}).

% PC moved this here from Chapter inter.tex 20sep2000
Anomalous diffusion for $1$\dmn\ intermittent maps was studied in
the  continuous time random walk approach in \refrefs{GeiTho,GNZ85}.
%%%maybe refer to Klafter Zumofen
The first approach within the framework of cycle expansions
(based on truncated \dzeta s)
was proposed in \refref{ACL93}. Our treatment follows methods
introduced in \refref{CGS92}, applied there to
investigate the behavior of the Lorentz gas with unbounded horizon.
\index{intermittency}
%Early treatments of anomalous diffusion (see \refref{intACL}) by means
%of
%cycle expansions involved truncated \dzeta s: as a matter of fact, by
%denoting with $\zeta_{0[t]}^{-1}(z,\beta)$ the truncation of the
%\dzeta\ at order $t$, the following behavior was argued
%\beq
%\sigma^2(t)\,\sim \, -t \left.\frac{\partial^2 /\partial \beta^2\,
%\zeta_{0[t]}^{-1} (z,\beta)}{\partial / \partial z \,
%\zeta_{0[t]}^{-1} (z,\beta)}\right|_{z=1,\beta=0}
%\label{ast}

%If we refer to the example treated in the text we can see how
%the two formulations are
%linked together again by Tauberian arguments (as anomalous diffusion in
%\refeq{ast} is related to divergence of $\sum_{k=1}^t c_k$, where
