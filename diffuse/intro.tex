The advances
in the theory of dynamical systems have brought
a new life to Boltzmann's mechanical formulation of statistical
mechanics.
% especially for systems near or far from equilibrium.
Sinai, Ruelle and Bowen (SRB) have generalized Boltzmann's notion
of ergodicity for a constant energy surface for a
Hamiltonian system in equilibrium to dissipative systems in
{nonequilibrium} stationary states. In this more general
setting the attractor plays the role of a constant energy surface,
and the SRB measure % of \refsect{s-measures}
is a generalization of the Liouville measure. Such measures are
purely microscopic and indifferent to whether the system is at
equilibrium, close to equilibrium or far from it.
``Far for equilibrium'' in this context refers to systems with
large deviations from Maxwell's equilibrium velocity distribution.
Furthermore, the theory of dynamical systems has yielded new sets
of microscopic dynamics formulas for macroscopic observables such as
diffusion constants and the pressure, to which we turn now.

We shall apply cycle expansions to the analysis of {\em transport}
properties of chaotic systems.

The resulting formulas are exact; no probabilistic assumptions are made, and
the all correlations are taken into account by the inclusion of cycles of all
periods.
The infinite extent
systems for which the periodic orbit theory yields formulas for
diffusion and other transport coefficients are
spatially periodic, the global {\statesp} being tiled with copies
of a elementary cell.
The motivation are physical problems such as
beam defocusing in particle accelerators
or chaotic behavior of passive tracers in $2$\dmn\ rotating flows,
problems which can be described as
deterministic diffusion in periodic arrays.

In \refsect{s-DiffPerArr} we derive the formulas for diffusion
coefficients in a simple physical setting, the $2$\dmn\ periodic Lorentz
gas.

the Lorentz systems in \refsect{s-lorentz}.

\section{Diffusion in periodic arrays}
\label{s-DiffPerArr}

The $2$\dmn\ {\em Lorentz gas} is an infinite
scatterer array in which
diffusion of a light molecule in a gas of heavy scatterers
is modeled by the motion of
a point particle in a plane bouncing off an array of reflecting disks.
The Lorentz gas is called ``gas'' as one can equivalently think of
it as consisting of any number of pointlike fast ``light molecules''
interacting only with the stationary ``heavy molecules''
and not among themselves.
As the scatterer array is built up from only
defocusing concave surfaces, it is a pure hyperbolic system,
and one of the simplest nontrivial dynamical systems that
exhibits deterministic diffusion,
\reffig{fig-lor-4}.
% The original Lorentz gas assumed a random distribution of heavy
% scatterers; in this case a probabilistic description is unavoidable.
We shall now show that the {\em periodic} Lorentz gas
is amenable to a purely deterministic treatment.
In this class of open dynamical systems
quantities characterizing global dynamics, such as
the Lyapunov exponent, pressure and diffusion constant, can be
computed from the dynamics restricted to the elementary cell.
The method applies to any  hyperbolic dynamical system that is
a periodic tiling $\hM=\bigcup_{ \hn \in T} \pS_{\hn}$
of the dynamical {\statesp} $\hM$ by {\em translates}
$\pS_{\hn}$
of an {\em elementary cell} $\pS$, with $T$ the abelian group of lattice
translations.
If the scattering array has further discrete symmetries, such
as reflection symmetry, each elementary cell may be built from a
{\em fundamental domain}
${\widetilde \pS}$
by the action of a discrete (not necessarily abelian) group $G$.
The symbol $\hM$ refers here to the full {\statesp}, \ie,,
both the spatial coordinates and the momenta.
The spatial component of $\hM$ is the complement
of the disks in the {\em whole} space.

We shall now relate the dynamics in $\pS$
to diffusive properties of the Lorentz gas in
$\hM$.

These concepts
are best illustrated by a specific example, a
Lorentz gas based on the hexagonal lattice
Sinai billiard of \reffig{fig-lor-1}.

We distinguish two types of diffusive behavior;
the {\em infinite horizon} case, which allows for infinite
length flights, and
the {\em finite horizon} case, where any free particle trajectory
must hit a disk in finite time.
In this chapter we shall restrict
our consideration to the finite horizon case,
with disks sufficiently
large so that no infinite length free flight is possible.
In this case the diffusion is normal, with $\hat{x}(t)^2$
growing like $t$.
We shall discuss the anomalous diffusion
case in \refsect{intersec:andiff}.

As we will work with three kinds of \statesp s, good manners require that
we repeat what tildes, nothings and hats atop symbols signify:

\label{atops}
\eea
It is convenient to define an \evOper\ for each of the 3
cases of \reffig{fig-lor-1}.
$\hx(t)\,=\,\hflow{t}{\hx}$
denotes the point in the global space
$\hM$
reached by the flow in time $t$.
$x(t)\,=\,\flow{t}{\xInit}$
denotes the corresponding flow in the elementary cell;
the two are related by
\beq
\hn_t(\xInit)= \hflow{t}{\xInit} - \flow{t}{\xInit} \in T
\,,
\ee{l-diff-hatn}
the translation of the endpoint of the global path into the
elementary cell $\pS$.
The quantity $\tx(t)\,=\,\tflow{t}{\tx}$
denotes the flow in the fundamental domain
${\widetilde \pS}$;
$\tflow{t}{\tx}$ is related to
$\flow{t}{\tx}$ by a discrete symmetry
$g \in G$ which maps $\tx(t)\in {\widetilde \pS}$ to
${x}(t) \in {\pS}$ .

Fix a vector $\beta \in \reals^d$, where $d$ is the dimension
of the {\statesp}. We will compute the diffusive properties
of the Lorentz gas from the leading eigenvalue of the
\evOper\ \refeq{(2)}
\beq
\eigenvL(\beta)\,=\, \lim_{t \rightarrow \infty} \frac{1}{t} \log
\langle e^{\beta \cdot (\hx(t) -x) } \rangle_\pS
~, \quad
\ee{lor-diff-1}
where the average %s are
is over all initial points in the elementary cell,
$x \in \pS$. %, $\tx \in {\widetilde \pS}$ respectively.

If all odd derivatives vanish by symmetry,
there is no drift
and the second derivatives
\[
2d D_{ij} =
\left . {{\partial} \over {\partial \beta_i}}
{{\partial} \over {\partial \beta_j}}
\eigenvL(\beta)\right |_{\beta=0} \,=\,\lim_{t\rightarrow \infty} {1\over t}
\langle {(\hx(t) -x)_i (\hx(t) -x)_j } \rangle_\pS ~,
\] %ee{lor-diff-4}
yield a diffusion matrix.
This symmetric matrix can, in general, be anisotropic
(\ie, have $d$ distinct eigenvalues and eigen\-vectors).
The spatial diffusion constant is then given by the Einstein
relation \refeq{(5)}
\[
D\,=\,{1\over 2 d} \sum_i
\left .{{\partial}^2 \over {\partial \beta^2_i}}
\eigenvL(\beta)\right |_{\beta=0}
\,=\, \lim_{t\rightarrow \infty} {1\over{2d t}}
\langle {(\hat{q}(t) -q)^2 } \rangle_\pS~
~,
\] %ee{lor_diff_5}
where the $i$ sum is restricted to the spatial components $q_i$ of
the {\statesp} vectors $x=(q,p)$, \ie, if the dynamics is Hamiltonian,
the sum is over
the $d$ degrees of freedom.

We now turn to the connection between \refeq{lor-diff-1} and periodic orbits
in the elementary cell.
% \toRem{r:LorentzFundDomain}
As the full $\hM \rightarrow {\widetilde \pS}$ reduction is complicated by
the non-abelian nature of $G$, we discuss only
the abelian $\hM \rightarrow \pS$ reduction.


\subsection{Reduction from $\hM$ to $\pS$}
\label{s-Red-hMto-pS}

The key idea follows from inspection of the relation
\bea
\expct{ e^{\beta \cdot (\hx(t) -x)} }_\pS
&=& {1 \over {|\pS|}} \int_{x \in \pS \atop \hat{y} \in \hM}
dx d\hat{y}\,
e^{\beta \cdot (\hat{y} -x) }
\delta(\hat{y} - \hflow{t}{x})~.
\nnu
%\ee{lor-diff-6}
\eea
 ${|\pS|=\int_\pS dx}$ is the volume of the elementary cell $\pS$.
Due to translational symmetry, it suffices to start with
a density of trajectories defined over a single elementary
cell $\pS$.
As in \refsect{s_aver_ev_op}, we have used the identity
$ 1 =  \intM{y} \prpgtr{y - \hx(t)}$ to motivate the introduction
of the {\evOper} $ \Lop^t(\hat{y},x)$.
There is a unique lattice translation $\hn$ such that
$\hat{y}=y - \hn$, with the endpoint $y \in \pS$
translated back to the elementary cell, and
$\flow{t}{x}$ given by \refeq{l-diff-hatn}. The difference is a
translation by a constant lattice vector $\hn$,
and the Jacobian for changing integration
from $d\hat{y}$ to $dy$ equals unity.
Therefore, and this is the main point, translation invariance
can be used to reduce this average to the elementary cell:
\beq
\langle e^{\beta \cdot (\hx(t) -x) } \rangle_\pS
\,=\, {1 \over {|\pS|}} \int_{x,y \in \pS} dx dy\,
e^{\beta \cdot (\hflow{t}{x} -x) }
\delta(y - \flow{t}{x})~.
\ee{lor-diff-7}
As this is a translation, the Jacobian is
$|\partial \hat{y}/\partial y| = 1$.
In this way the global $\hflow{t}{x}$ flow,
infinite volume \statesp\ averages can be computed
by following the flow $\flow{t}{\xInit}$ restricted to the
compact, finite volume elementary cell $\pS$.
The equation \refeq{lor-diff-7} suggests that we study the
\evOper
\beq
\Lop^t(y,x)\,=\,e^{\beta \cdot (\hx(t) -x) } \delta(y-\flow{t}{x})
\,,
\ee{lor-diff-8}
where $\hx(t)\,=\,\hflow{t}{x} \in \hM$ is the displacement in the
full space, but $x$, $\flow{t}{x}$, $y \in \pS$.
It is straightforward to check that
this operator satisfies the semigroup property \refeq{SemiGrp},
\[
\int_{\pS} dz\,
\Lop^{t_2}(y,z) \Lop^{t_1}(z,x) \,=\,
\Lop^{t_2+t_1}(y,x)~
\,.
\]
For $\beta=0$, the operator \refeq{lor-diff-8} is the
\FPoper\ \refeq{TransOp1}, with the
leading eigenvalue $e^{\eigenvL_0}=1$ because there is no escape from
this system (see
the flow conservation sum rule \refeq{prob-cons}).

The rest is old hat.
% \toSect{s-tr-flows}
The spectrum of $ \Lop$ is evaluated by taking the trace
\[
\tr\Lop^t\,=\,\int_\pS dx\,
 e^{\beta \cdot \hn_t(x) } \delta(x-x(t))~.
\] %ee{lor_diff_10}
Here $\hn_t(x)$
is the discrete lattice translation defined in  \refeq{l-diff-hatn}.
Two kinds of orbits periodic in the elementary cell contribute.
A periodic orbit is called {\em standing}
\index{standing orbit!Lorentz gas}
if it is also
periodic orbit of the infinite {\statesp}
dynamics, $\hflow{\period{p}}{x}=x$,
and it is called {\em running}
\index{running orbit!Lorentz gas}
if it corresponds to
a lattice translation in the dynamics on the infinite {\statesp},
$\hflow{\period{p}}{x}=x+\hn_p$.
We recognize the shortest repeating segment of a
running orbit as our old `\rpo' friend from
\refchap{c-discrete}.
In the theory of area--preserving
maps such as the standard map of \refexam{s:StandMap}
these orbits are called
{\em accelerator modes},
as the diffusion takes place along the momentum rather than the
position coordinate.
The traveled distance $\hn_p=\hn_{\period{p}}(\xInit)$
is independent of the starting point $\xInit$, as can be easily seen by
continuing the path periodically in $\hM$.
\index{accelerator mode}

PC{recheck usage ``standing,'' ``running'' with the literature.}

The final result is the \Fd\  \refeq{Z(s)}
\beq
\det(\eigenvL (\beta) - \Aop)  \,=\,\prod_{p}
\exp \left( - {
               \sum_{r=1}^\infty {1 \over r}
               {
                e^{(\beta \cdot \hn_p- s \period{p}) r}
                    % z^{\cl{p} r}
 \over  \oneMinJ{r}
                }
  % { | \det \left( {\bf 1}-\monodromy_p^{r} \right) | } }
              } \right)
\,,
\ee{lor-diff-14}
or the corresponding \dzeta\ \refeq{zet}
\beq
1/\zeta(\beta, s)\,=\,\prod_{p}\left( 1 - \frac{e^{(\beta \cdot
\hn_p- s \period{p})}}{|\ExpaEig_p|} \right)
~.
\label{zeta-diff}
\eeq
The
%associated
\dzeta\ \cycForm\ \refeq{dzeta} for
the diffusion constant \refeq{(5)}, zero mean drift
$
\expct{ \hat{x}_i } = 0
\,,
$
is given by
\beq
D \,=\,{1 \over 2 d} { \expct{\hat{x}^2}_\zeta \over \expct{\period{}}_\zeta }
  \,=\,{1 \over 2 d } \, {1 \over \expct{\period{}}_\zeta}
  \sumprime \frac{(-1)^{k+1}
  (\hn_{p_1}+ \cdots+ \hn_{p_k})^2}
  {|\ExpaEig_{p_1}\cdots \ExpaEig_{p_k}|}
\, .
\label{(17)}
\eeq
where the sum is over all distinct non-repeating combination
of prime cycles.
The derivation is standard, still the formula is strange.
Diffusion is unbounded motion across an infinite lattice;
nevertheless, the reduction to the elementary cell
enables us to compute relevant quantities
in the usual way, in terms of periodic orbits.

A sleepy reader might protest that
$x(\period{p})-x(0)$ is manifestly equal to zero for
a periodic orbit. That is correct; $\hn_p$ in the
above formula refers to a displacement $\hat{x}(\period{p})$
on the {\em infinite} periodic
lattice, while $p$ refers to closed orbit of the dynamics
$\flow{t}{x}$ reduced to the
elementary cell, with $x_p$ a periodic point in the closed prime
cycle $p$.

Even so, this is not an obvious formula. Globally periodic
orbits have $\hat{x}_p^2 =0$, and contribute only to the
time normalization $\expct{\period{}}_\zeta$. The mean square displacement
$\expct{\hat{x}^2}_\zeta$ gets contributions only from the
periodic runaway trajectories; they are closed in the
elementary cell, but on the periodic lattice each one grows like
$\hat{x}(t)^2 = (\hn_{p}/\period{p})^2 t^2 = v^2_p t^2$.
So the orbits that contribute to the trace formulas and
\Fd s exhibit either ballistic
transport or no transport at all: diffusion arises as a balance
between the two kinds of motion,
weighted by the $1/|\ExpaEig_p|$ measure. If the system is not
hyperbolic such weights may be abnormally large, with $1/|\ExpaEig_p|
\approx 1/\period{p}^\alpha$ rather than
$1/|\ExpaEig_p| \approx e^{-\period{p}\Lyap}$, where $\Lyap$ is the Lyapunov
exponent, and they may lead to anomalous diffusion - accelerated or
slowed down depending on whether the probabilities of the running or the
standing orbits are enhanced.
% \toSect{intersec:andiff}

We illustrate the main idea, tracking of a globally diffusing
orbit by the associated confined orbit restricted to the
elementary cell, with the Lorentz gas.

We now return to
the problem of computing the diffusion coefficient
for a ``finite horizon'' Lorentz gas on a hexagonal lattice
introduced in \refsect{s-DiffPerArr}.
%By finite horizon we mean any arrangement of scatterers which does
%not allow for infinitely long free flights of the moving particle.
%A random arrangement of scatterers always produces finite horizon,
%while for a regular lattice of scatterers different conditions on
%their spacing must be imposed, depending on the particular arrangement.

{Comment by Lamberto}

We are not going to describe in full detail all the calculations that
have performed for such a system, our main goal is to provide a
physically relevant example where the symbolic dynamics is
enormously complicated, and application of formulas like \refeq{(17)}
is problematic. The complexity of symbolic dynamics for this
system has a very clear and profound mathematical justification:
%In practice we will point out how serious are the problems
%encountered in applying formulas like \refeq{(17)}
%to this system.
%From the point of view of
%From a general point of view these difficulties are expected,
%since the organization of cycles suffers from the complexity of the
%symbolic dynamics for such systems:
Markov partitions
for disperse billiards are made of an infinite
countable collection of pieces, very unevenly sized. The source of
troubles are the grazing
singularities, corresponding to the orbits that are tangent to
a disk: a cone of trajectories close to the tangent one is split
into two pieces at the tangency point, and the
process repeats at every tangency. This mechanism
causes the global unstable and stable manifolds to consist of a
countable number of smooth components.
Thus the presence of singularities in a sense weakens the strong
chaotic properties induced by complete hyperbolicity (due to the
fact that any single collision leads to defocusing, and that the
time between two successive collisions if bounded from above by a
finite quantity).

Let us first define the parameters of the model: we set the disk radius
$R=1$
and denote by $w$ the disk to disk distance, so that the centers of two
neighboring disks are separated by a distance $2+w$. For a hexagonal
lattice we require $0\leq w \leq 4/\sqrt{3}-2$ in order that
the finite horizon condition be satisfied.

\subsection{Lorentz gas: symbolic dynamics}

If we start a trajectory from any scatterer in the lattice,
under the condition of finite horizon, there are two
possibilities for the next hit: either it takes place on one of the six
neighboring disks, or on one of the six
next-to-nearest disks. Hence we may introduce an alphabet, by labeling
these disks clockwise from $0$ to $11$: if we assign the label $0$ to one
of the closest obstacles, even labels will then correspond to short flights,
see \reffig{f_simb_lor}.
%as in \reffig{f_simb_lor}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%\FIG{
%\includegraphics[width=0.60\textwidth]{lor_011}
%}{}{
%Symbolic dynamics for closely packed Lorentz gas.
%}{f_simb_lor}

Then, any trajectory (without grazing collisions) may be uniquely
identified by assigning one of these twelve symbols to each free
flight. The way this is done is to let the symbol for a free flight
depend on the vector separation between initial and final point of
such a segment of trajectory. Then, one should imagine that the
center of
\reffig{f_simb_lor}  is always translated to the scatterer
where the free flight starts,
and that the symbol for the flight is the one of the scatterer
where it ends. So, in practice, for a spacing $w=0.3$, which
is just below the finite horizon condition, one has only four types
of cycles with two collisions, \ie, orbits which indefinitely
repeat the same symbol sequence of two symbols:
%\cite{MR94}:
the are of course short orbits between two neighboring scatterers,
like $(0~6)$ (next neighbors) or $(1~7)$ (next to nearest
neighbors), as well as $(1~5)$ and $(0~5)$ orbits. All these
orbits belong to {\em groups}, characterized by the same layout,
and differing just in the orientation: this is of course due to
the symmetry properties of the system: as the symmetry group is
discrete there is a maximum number of different orbits in each group
(which is $24$ in the case under consideration).
The fact that the different orbits of one kind
are oriented in different directions does not affect their
length $\tau$ and their Lyapunov exponent $\lambda$,
which are exactly the same
for all orbits within a group.
The number of distinct orbits within one
group, and the corresponding product $\tau \lambda$, which
appears in the definition of the Floquet multipliers are
listed in \reftab{t-diff-1}, for cycles of length 2 and 3.

It is clear from these considerations that not all possible symbol
strings actually give rise to cycles. This is because the symbolic
dynamics for the Lorentz gas is marred by a large amount of pruning.
For instance,
there is an obvious pruning rule that the same symbol
cannot be repeated twice,
as this would correspond to a trajectory crossing a disk.
Many more pruning rules are present: for instance, in the dense gas we
consider here not only a letter cannot repeat, but the next symbol has to vary
at least by two units after a short flight, and by three units after a long
flight. The immense amount of pruning present in the problem may be
appreciated by looking at the second column of
\reftab{t-diff-3},
%{t-diff-4}
in which the
number of cycles is reported as a function of cycle length: order by
order we get roughly an increase by $3$, instead of the factor $11$
which would come from an unrestricted grammar (keeping into account
only the non--crossing condition, which effectively reduces by one
the possible symbols that can follow any given one).


\subsection{Diffusion}

We now apply the formula \refeq{(17)} for a particular value of the spacing
$w=0.3$.

Together with estimates of the diffusion coefficient we may also
provide estimates for the Lyapunov exponent (see \refsect{s-Lyapunovs}).
Moreover,
since no trajectory escapes, the escape rate is zero, and the
\Fd\ and the \dzeta\ must satisfy the material flow conservation rule
\refeq{prob-cons}: the results for all these quantities are reported in
\reftab{t-diff-3},
where cells have been sampled with the variational method described
in \refrem{r-varPrinc}.

%\LR{Table added by Lamberto}

As mentioned above a lot of symbol sequences are pruned when
the required finite horizon is achieved by making the spacing between disks
small enough. So very poor
convergence of cycle expansions has to be expected. With this in mind the
numbers given in \reftab{t-diff-3} are in a reasonable
accord with the probability conservation
and offer a rather poor, but not unreasonable, estimate of
the Lyapunov exponent.
%(compare with the
%more accurate estimates of \reftab{t-diff-5a}).
Nevertheless, the estimates of the diffusion constant
up to the number of cycles employed so far appear to converge very
slowly. They seem to be more sensitive to the bad shadowing than the Lyapunov
exponent and the probability conservation. Of course, one should
remember that the diffusion coefficient is a higher order moment
of the generating function, hence it should be expected
to be harder to get.
%
%\subsection{Dilute Lorentz gas}
%
%In order to test the diffusion formula under less trying conditions,
%we eliminate pruning by making the spacing between disks larger,
%and imposing the finite horizon by fiat; in this section
%we consider the measure zero subset of those orbits
%which after each bounce travel only to one
%of the nearest or next nearest disks. This Cantor set
%is a repeller, and the material flow is not conserved. Estimates of the
%Lyapunov exponent and the diffusion constant for trajectories
%restricted to this set are given in \reftab{t-diff-2a}.

%\subsection{Trace formulas, numerical simulations}

A way to circumvent the poorness of shadowing, due to severe and
badly controllable pruning, is just going back to trace formulas
%$D$ values listed in the last column in \reftab{t-diff-3}
%are calculated from the trace formula
\refeq{averf}

T_x/|\ExpaEig_x|}
\label{DL-trace}
\eeq
% of the same form we used to derive exact results for cat maps \refeq{Dcat}.
%A very long trajectory
%of the order of $10^{10}$ collisions was used to find cycles
% as described in the previous remark.
% This way, they were able to carry on their calculation
%up to cycle length $10$, missing
%a number of cycles, for the reasons explained
%in the previous remark.
For cycle
length $9$ \refref{MR94} reports
$D_{tr}\simeq 0.240$, and for cycle length $10$ $D_{tr}\simeq 0.2501$,
which is not too far from the result of direct simulations (see
\reffig{f-diff-dpolt}).
The apparent better performance of trace formulas over cycle expansions in
this context is rather unexpected, and no strong theoretical clue
is offered to justify this observation, but the very simple
fact that trace formulas automatically include probability conservation,
as the average is always computed by using a normalized measure.
%
%and only a partial explanation has
%been provided so far.

%
%\subsection{On the effect of pruning on cycle expansions}
%
%\authorLR
%
%\noindent
%The unexpected better performance of trace formulas over cycle
%expansions, in the study of the Lorentz gas is even more pronounced
%at smaller spacings $w$. This suggests that pruning has something to
%do with that, and that there may be a way of limiting its disastrous
%effects.
%
%First observe the following. In order to have good convergence in
%cycle expansions it is necessary that the curvature correction
%terms like  $(t_{ab} - t_a t_b)$, where $ab$ is a generic symbol string,
%``shadowed'' by the product of strings $a$ and $b$, rapidly tend to
%zero. However, because of pruning in the Lorentz gas, there is
%a large mismatch in the number of prime and shadowing strings.
%For instance, at $w$=0.3 there are $24$ cycles
%of length $2$, which means that $276$ shadowing approximants
%of length $4$ can be formed by taking their products.
%However, there are only $168$ prime cycles of length $4$.
%At length $5$, there are $1536$ product strings to match with
%only $516$ prime cycles. Similarly, at length $6$ there are
%$6480$ product strings contributing a positive amount to
%the cycle expansion, $2024$
%product strings contributing a negative amount, and $1262$
%prime strings contributing a negative amount. Moreover,
%there are many prime strings which do not even have a shadowing
%approximant. These problems do not ease at higher periods,
%which makes the convergence of the cycle expansions rather slow.
%
%On the other hand, trace formulas do not arrange the different
%terms into curvature correction blocks, and they are explicitly
%normalized at all periods. This produces two effects. First, taking
%longer and longer cycles simply makes each single cycle
%look closer and closer to an ergodic trajectory itself (from a
%numerical point of view). Secondly, if the cycles are selected
%with the method of \refrem{r-ergSys}, their contributions
%are naturally distributed in a range wich contains the correct
%average, and weighing them with a probability
%measure can only produce a number in the same range.
%
%This somehow gives an idea of why trace formulas performed better
%than cycle expansions in Lorentz gas calculations. At the same time,
%these facts
This fact suggests that the performance
of cycle expansions for systems with strong pruning,
might be improved by imposing by hand the condition of
probability conservation at all orders of approximation.

%\subsection{Lattice symmetry and diffusion}
%\label{s-Latt-sym}

%In order to perform the full reduction for diffusion one has to
%express the \dzeta\ \refeq{zeta-diff} in terms of the prime cycles of the
%fundamental domain $\tilde \pS$ of the lattice
%(see \reffig{fig-lor-1}) rather than
%\PC{need here fig-lor-2 - where did it go?}
%those of the elementary (Wigner-Seitz) cell $\pS$.  This problem
%presents the following
%difficulty. The stumbling block appears to be
% the breaking of the rotational symmetry by
% the auxiliary vector $\beta$, or, in other words,
%the non-commutativity of translations and rotations.
%More precisely, the global distance
%$ \hat\phi^{r \period{p}} (\tx{\tpk}) - \tx{\tpk} $, $\tx{\tpk} \in {\tilde p}$,
% $ \hn_{r |\tilde p|}(\tx{\tpk}) $
%depends on the starting periodic point if
%${\tilde p}$ is only a segment of the global cycle $p$. An
%example is the diamond-shaped cycle of \reffig{fig-lor-3};
%the problem is that the ${\tilde p}$ segment of
%the global trajectory is not a translation in $\hM$.
%depending on whether one starts at $\tx_1$ or $\tx_2$, the global
%distance covered in time $\period{p}$ is either the short or the
%long diagonal.
%This difficulty can be handled in the following way.

%$\rho(x)$ on which the

%be decomposed using the projectors onto the irreducible representations of the
%full point group.  For an arbitrary wavenumber $k=-i \beta$, the

%can express by

%components of the density.  With \refeq{dif-lor-3.2}, the
% Perron-Frobenius operator
%\evOper\ is reduced to the flow in the fundamental domain $\tilde \pS$.
%The \dzeta\ can then be written as a product

%$\tilde{\bf R}_{\tilde p}(k)^r$ split into block-diagonal submatrices which

The classical Boltzmann equation for evolution of 1-particle
density is based on {\em stosszahlansatz},
neglect of particle correlations prior to, or after a 2-particle
collision.
\index{stosszahlansatz}
It is a very good approximate description of dilute gas dynamics,
but a difficult starting point for inclusion of systematic corrections.
\index{Boltzmann!equation}
In the theory developed here, no correlations are neglected - they
are all included in the \cycForm\ such as the cycle expansion for the
diffusion constant
\[
D \,=\,{1 \over 2 d } \, {1 \over \expct{\period{}}_\zeta}
\sumprime (-1)^{k+1}
    \frac{
(\hn_{p_1} + \cdots + \hn_{p_k})^2
    }{
|\ExpaEig_{p_1} \cdots\ExpaEig_{p_k}|
    }
\, .
\]
Such formulas are {\em exact}; the issue in their applications is
what are the most effective schemes of estimating the infinite cycle
sums required for their evaluation. Unlike most statistical
mechanics, here there are no phenomenological macroscopic parameters;
quantities such as transport coefficients are calculable to any
desired accuracy from the microscopic dynamics.

For systems of a few degrees of freedom these results are on rigorous
footing, but there are indications that they capture the essential
dynamics of systems of many degrees of freedom as well.

Though superficially indistinguishable from the probabilistic random
walk diffusion, deterministic diffusion is quite recognizable, at
least in low dimensional settings, through fractal dependence of the
diffusion constant on the system parameters, and through non-Gaussion
relaxation to equilibrium (non-vanishing Burnett coefficients).
\index{Burnett coefficients}

That Smale's ``structural stability" conjecture turned out to be
wrong is not a bane of chaotic dynamics - it is actually a virtue,
perhaps the most dramatic experimentally measurable prediction of
chaotic dynamics. As long as microscopic periodicity is exact, the
prediction is counterintuitive for a physicist - transport
coefficients are {\em not} smooth functions of system parameters,
rather they are non-monotonic, {\em nowhere differentiable}
functions.
\index{structural stability}

Actual evaluation of transport coefficients is a test of the
techniques developed above in physical settings. In cases of severe
pruning the trace formulas and ergodic sampling of dominant cycles
might be more effective strategy than the cycle expansions of \dzeta
s and systematic enumeration of all cycles.

{Lack of structural stability for D.}{
Expressions like \refeq{D-KD} may lead to an expectation that
the diffusion coefficient (and thus transport properties) are
smooth functions of the chaoticity of the system
(parameterized, for example, by the Lyapunov exponent $\Lyap =
\ln \ExpaEig$). This turns out not to be true: $D$ as a
function of $\ExpaEig$ is a fractal, nowhere differentiable
curve shown in \reffig{f-Klage}. The dependence of $D$ on the
map parameter $\ExpaEig$ is rather unexpected - even though for
larger $\ExpaEig$ more points are mapped outside the unit cell
in one iteration, the diffusion constant does not necessarily
grow. We refer the reader to \refrefs{detdiff1,detdiff2} for
early work on the deterministic diffusion induced by 1\dmn\
maps. The sawtooth map \refeq{KD-map} was introduced by
Grossmann and Fujisaka\rf{gro} who derived the integer slope
formulas \refeq{D-KD} for the diffusion constant. The sawtooth
map is also discussed in \refrefs{GB92}. The fractal dependence
of diffusion constant on the map parameter is discussed in
\refrefs{RKdiss,KlaDor95,KlaDor97}. \refSect{s:ChaosGood} gives
a brief summary of the experimental implications; for the the
current state of the art of fractal transport coefficients consult
the first part of Klage's monograph\rf{RKbook07}. Would be nice if
someone would eventually check these predictions in
experiments...
Statistical
mechanicians tend to believe that such complicated behavior is
not to be expected in systems with very many degrees of
freedom, as the addition to a large integer dimension of a
number smaller than $1$ should be as unnoticeable as a
microscopic perturbation of a macroscopic quantity. No
fractal-like behavior of the conductivity for the Lorentz gas
has been detected so far\rf{LNRM94}.

{Symmetry factorization in one dimension.}{
In the $\beta=0$ limit the dynamics
\refeq{sym2} is symmetric under $x \rightarrow -x$, and the
zeta functions factorize into products of zeta functions for
the symmetric and antisymmetric subspaces, as
described in \refsect{Reflecti}:
\bea
{1 \over \zeta(0,z)} &=& {1 \over \zeta_{s}(0,z)}\,{1 \over \zeta_{a}(0,z)}

 +
 { 1 \over \zeta_a} {\pde \over \pde z} { 1 \over \zeta_s}
\,.
\label{diffSymmetr}
\eea
The leading (material flow conserving) eigenvalue $z=1$ belongs
to the symmetric subspace
\(
{1 / \zeta_s(0,1)}=0
\),
so the derivatives \refeq{MeanTime} also depend
only on the symmetric subspace:
\bea
\expct{n}_\zeta &=&
   \left. z{\pde \over \pde z} {1 \over \zeta(0,z)}\right|_{z=1}

    \left.{1 \over \zeta_{s}(0,z)}\right|_{z=1} \, .

%pruning rule that `f' can only follow an uppercase
%letter (\ie, a long segment) and `F' only a lowercase letter.
%The symbols given to an orbit by this scheme are invariant under all spatial
%symmetries of the system but not under the time reversal.
%The fact is that time reversal symmetry is included in the spatial
%symmetries, at least for running orbits, as a consequence of the
%absence of external fields, and of the geometry of the model.
%
%\LR{PLEASE, make sure that this comment makes sense}
%
%Of the possible twelve symbols,  `A', `B', `f' and `F'
%are pruned as soon as the horizon gets finite.
%\\
%(PC: finite or densely packed???)\\
%TS: finite !
%Among the remaining symbols there is
%still strong pruning,  reflected in the fact that
%for $w = 0.3$ the
%number of cycles of symbol length $n$
%does not grow like $8^n$ but roughly as
%$3^n$. Figure~5? shows
%\RA{insert fig. 5 from \refref{CGS}}
%all the fundamental domain fixed
%points which are not pruned at $w=0.3$ together with an example
%of a pruned fixed point.
%
%
%Table~4 gives some impression of the pruning involved.
%In order that longer orbits be shadowed by shorter ones,
%for every combination of two symbols a two-cycle,
%and the fixed points corresponding to each of the symbols should exist.
%Two-cycles such as `ac', `aC', \ldots are missing while
%corresponding ``shadowing'' pseudo-cycles `a~c', `a~C' exist, and
%conversely, two-cycles occur where one of the symbols
%has no corresponding fixed point
%(e.g. the symbol `d' in `ad'). So
%the shadowing is largely disfunctional,
%at least as long as finite approximate Markov partitions are
%not developed.
%Nevertheless the finite order estimates for the Lyapunov exponent and
%material flow conservation, reported in \reftab{t-diff-5a}, are rather good, and noticeably
%better than the corresponding calculation using elementary cell dynamics
%(\reftab{t-diff-1}).

%Both in the elementary cell and in the fundamental domain convergence is
%dramatically better with more separated disks because there is no more pruning.
%Unfortunately, then the dynamics is artificially reduced to the cantor set

In order to perform the full reduction for diffusion one should
express the \dzeta\ \refeq{zeta-diff} in terms of the prime cycles of the
fundamental domain $\tilde \pS$ of the lattice
(see \reffig{fig-lor-1}) rather than
%\PC{need here fig-lor-2 - where did it go?}
those of the elementary (Wigner-Seitz) cell $\pS$.  This problem
is complicated by
%presents the following
%difficulty. The stumbling block appears to be
the breaking of the rotational symmetry by
the auxiliary vector $\beta$, or, in other words,
the non-commutativity of translations and rotations: see
%f.ex.
\refref{CEG}.

``From Deterministic Chaos to Deterministic Diffusion''
by R. Klages, \arXiv{0804.3068}: ``
A set of easy-to-read lecture notes for a short first-year Ph.D.
student course. The notes cover five hours of lectures and
do not require any prior knowledge on dynamical systems. The first part introduces
to deterministic chaos in one-dimensional maps in form of Lyapunov exponents
and the metric entropy. The second part first outlines the concept of
deterministic diffusion. Then the escape rate formalism for deterministic
diffusion, which expresses the diffusion coefficient in terms of the above two
chaos quantities, is worked out for a simple map. The notes conclude with a
very brief sketch of anomalous diffusion.
