  \item[2019-07-27 Predrag]
Vul, Sinai and Khanin\rf{VuSiKh84} 1984 {\em Feigenbaum universality and
the thermodynamic formalism} paper discusses the stable-unstable manifold
of the period-doubling operator fixed point, as well as the complex plane
period-tripling fixed point (contemporaneously with the independent 1983
Cvitanovi{\'c} and Myrheim work\rf{myrh1,CviMyr89}). There is also the
1982 Vul and Khanin\rf{VulKha82} {\em The unstable separatrix of
{Feigenbaum}'s fixed-point} that does not seem to get cited.

Feigenbaum introduced presentation functions in his 1988
paper\rf{Feigenbaum88} {\em Presentation functions, fixed points, and a
theory of scaling function dynamics}. The lack of physics community
interest in his presentation functions is indeed one of the reasons
Feigenbaum gave up on journal publications
(Safmann-Taylor\rf{Feigenbaum02} instability was the final nail in the
coffin).

``Dual Cantor set'' {seems to only} refer to the manner of labelling a
binary tree-organized Cantor set (see 1990 PhD thesis by Sullivan's
student
\HREF{http://qcpages.qc.cuny.edu/~yjiang/HomePageYJ/Download/1990PHDThesisYPJ.pdf}
{Y. Jiang}). I suspect this is what is called ``alternating  binary
tree'' in
\HREF{http://www.chaosbook.org/chapters/ChaosBook.pdf\#section.14.3}
{ChaosBook.org}.

The notion of ``dual Cantor set'' seems to have been introduced by
Sullivan\rf{Sullivan88} in the June 1987 Noto (or what Predrag calls ``No
to NATO'') conference\rf{GalZwe88}, where Feigenbaum, Siggia,
Cvitanovi{\'c}, Lanford, Swinney, Libchaber, etc. also spoke. Sullivan
writes: ``Feigenbaum expressed this discovery in terms of a universal
scaling function for the Cantor set. [...] the fine structure is codified
by a scaling function defined on a logically distinct perfect set - the
dual Cantor set. The main unsolved mystery is why the renormalizations
converge. '' (I have no access to the full lecture, so do not know what
other credit Sullivan gives to whom, but it also appears in the equally
unaccessible \refref{Wells88}).

In Birkhoff, Martens and Tresser\rf{BiMaTr03}
{\em On the scaling structure for period doubling} they write:
``For  completeness  and  to fix notations  and  definitions,  we include
some  basic discussion  of the scaling function,  whose origin is rather
diffuse:  first  conjectures  about a form  of it  appeared  in Coullet
and Tresser\rf{CouTre78}, the name and a  form  of it  come from
Feigenbaum\rf{Feigenbaum80}, while what  was  arguably the first theorem
about  it was in a never circulated  work by Feigenbaum  and  Sullivan.
The literature  on  scaling functions  is  extensive  and  discusses
scaling functions  beyond  the context  of dynamics.  In  particular,  in
1984 Vul, Sinai and Khanin paper\rf{VuSiKh84}  a  relation  with  the
thermodynamic  formalism  appeared.''
They do not bother to actually plot the scaling function they construct,
but as their ``universal period doubling scaling function $q$ is strictly
monotone and the range forms a Cantor set'' I think it is not the same
as:

Feigenbaum\rf{Feigenbaum80} {\em The transition to aperiodic behavior in
turbulent systems} constructs the scaling function $\sigma$ and plots it in
his Fig.~2.

The 1984 Vul, Sinai and Khanin survey\rf{VuSiKh84} is impressive. It does
discuss Feigenbaum attractor as a binary-labelled Cantor set, but I see
no ``dual" anywhere. ``Thermodynamic formalism'' is in the title, but
mentioned only once in the text. It is developed in sect.~4 in the usual
way. They note that the numerical work of Grassberger\rf{Grassberger81},
{\em On the {Hausdorff} dimension of fractal attractors}, gives a more
accurate number. Summa summarum, I see no scaling functions in Vul, Sinai
and Khanin survey\rf{VuSiKh84}. Seems to be something that was introduced
by Feigenbaum and Sullivan in different forms, but while interacting with
each other. I'm no wiser than that.
